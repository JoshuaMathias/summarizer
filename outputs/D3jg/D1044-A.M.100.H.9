The red-coloured dye, which is used for colouring non-edible items such as petrol and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli powder used by the British company Premium Foods to make Worcester Sauce, which was then used as an ingredient in a wide range of products, the FSA said.
The red dye Sudan I has been found in a pepper sauce made by the Heinz Meiweiyuan Food Co. based in Guangzhou, capital of southern China's Guangdong province, Xinhua news agency said.
Sudan-I is traditionally used for coloring solvents, oils, waxes, petrol and shoe and floor polishes.
