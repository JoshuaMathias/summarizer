The 23-foot (7-meter) wall of water, stirred up by a magnitude-7 undersea earthquake, also destroyed at least three other villages Friday night when it crashed into the northwest coast of Papua New Guinea, a nation on the island of New Guinea, north of Australia, where some people live a near-Stone Age existence amid jungles and swamps.
As Australian aid workers opened a field hospital on high ground and relief supplies began trickling in, Papua New Guinea's prime minister, Bill Skate, toured the worst-hit villages and the Sissano lagoon, choked with dead fish and hundreds of rotting human bodies.
