The district attorney in Colorado overseeing the JonBenet Ramsey homicide case on Friday appointed two new special prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury.
After the jurors reconvene in January, they are expected to hear from neighbors and employees of the Ramseys in Boulder, as well as many members of the Ramsey family, including the 6-year-old girl's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey.
Linda Arndt, who was the only detective in John and Patsy Ramsey's home when their daughter's body was found, has resigned from the Boulder Police Department after 11 years.
