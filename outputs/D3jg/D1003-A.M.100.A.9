Nature preserve workers in northwest China's Gansu Province have formulated a rescue plan to save giant pandas from food shortage caused by arrow bamboo flowering.
Wu said the regional telcom network covers the administrative office building of Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, a giant panda museum, and China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Pandas (CCRCGP), the open-air habitat for the endangered species.
The National Zoo's female panda, Mei Xiang, gave birth early Saturday morning to a squealing cub the size of a stick of butter, and keepers say she is caring for it tenderly.
