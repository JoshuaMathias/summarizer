After a week of steadily increasing seismic rumbling, Mount St. Helens on Friday burped a tall column of steam and ash that officials said was probably not a precursor to a large sustained eruption from the most active volcano on the West Coast.
The earthquakes quit after the eruption, said University of Washington seismologist Tony Qamar.
But those events, coming after the mountain erupted Friday for the first time in 18 years, were still less serious than what scientists closely monitoring the mountain had anticipated, and the scientists were still saying Monday that a more significant eruption was likely.
