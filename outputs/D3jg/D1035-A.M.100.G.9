Le Cao Dai, one of Vietnam's top experts on the health effects of Agent Orange, first encountered American military herbicides when he ran a field hospital for the North Vietnamese army along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
Vietnam has an estimated 1 million victims of Agent Orange, the toxic defoliant widely used by U.S. forces during the Vietnam War, according to the Vietnamese vice president.
An Air Force study of veterans who sprayed Agent Orange during the Vietnam War found the strongest evidence to date that exposure to the herbicide is associated with diabetes, officials said today.
