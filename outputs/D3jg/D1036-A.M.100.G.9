The illness that disfigured the face of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko resulted from poisoning by the toxic substance dioxin, which might have been placed deliberately in his food, Austrian doctors who treated him told reporters in Vienna on Saturday.
But some toxicologists and students of chemical crimes say poison probably is wielded more often than people think.
Ukraine's parliament decided Tuesday to investigate the recent sacking of the deputy chief of the country's SBU security service amid persisting questions on the poisoning of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko who has accused authorities of trying to kill him.
