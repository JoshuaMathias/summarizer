The office of Indonesia's attorney general has formed a team to investigate the wealth of present and former Indonesian government officials, a spokesman of the office said here Tuesday.
Habibie Monday instructed Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib to study intensively all the data provided by the U.S. Time magazine on the alleged wealth of former President Soeharto and his family abroad.
Indonesian former president Soeharto will not come to the Attorney General Office on Monday to undergo an investigation on corruption cases due to health reasons, chief of Soeharto's legal defender team Juan Felix Tampubolon said here on Friday.
