A Maryland environmentalist alarmed by the decline of the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster population is trying to get it on the federal Endangered Species list -- sparking an uproar of opposition in the oyster industry from Maine to Louisiana.
The cleanup, led by Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C., along with nearly a dozen federal agencies, is known as the Chesapeake Bay Program.
But these days the harvest of native oysters, decimated by disease, pollution and overfishing, is measured in tens of thousands of bushels a year, a tiny fraction of the 20 million bushels that were once taken.
