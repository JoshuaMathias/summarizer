Five Caribbean islands canceled tropical storm watches Friday night as Floyd, packing winds of 110 mph, moved further out to sea, the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported.
Hurricane Floyd strengthened to a very dangerous Category 4 storm today with 155 mph wind, surprising forecasters and charging toward the Bahamas on a path that also threatened the Florida coast.
In Nassau, the capital, authorities lost telephone links throughout the vulnerable, low-lying archipelago -- including Eleuthera, San Salvador and Cat Island -- where winds reached 110 mph and damage was feared to be extensive.
