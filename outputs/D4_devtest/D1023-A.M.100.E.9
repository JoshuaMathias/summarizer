At least eight people have been confirmed killed and 30 others injured as two avalanches roared through a ski resort in Austria's western state of Triol on Tuesday evening, the Austrian news media reported.
LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Another killer avalanche brought new heartache to Western Austria today, striking just miles from where rescuers were digging for victims of Europe's worst snowslide this winter.
Landeck and Galtuer are separated by mountains more than 8,000 to 10,000 feet high, fearsome, jagged peaks that, from the air Wednesday, looked softened and benign under their heavy coats of blinding white snow.
