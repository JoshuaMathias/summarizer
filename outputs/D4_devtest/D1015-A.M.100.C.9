China's largest tropical rain forest, in the Xishuangbanna nature reserve in Yunnan Province, will get further protection when the reserve is enlarged from 247,000 ha to 533,000 ha, according to Zhuang Yan, head of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture.
In Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Central America, Africa, and Indonesia, fires have destroyed nearly 40 million forested acres, an area as large as New York state.
But the main culprit, as always, is human activity, chiefly logging, mining, and agriculture, which dries out the forest by stripping it bare of trees, leaving even humid tropical rain forests vulnerable to fire.
