Less than a week after Merck & Co. yanked its popular Vioxx arthritis drug off the market, the New England Journal of Medicine voiced strong concerns Wednesday about the safety of Pfizer's bestselling Celebrex.
Pfizer's medical director, Dr. Gail Cawkwell, insisted that its drugs are safe.
Vioxx, Celebrex and Bextra are the only three drugs in a class known as Cox-2 inhibitors.
Most analysts and doctors were expecting the FDA to seek additional information before approving Arcoxia because Merck pulled Vioxx from the market last month after a study showed it doubled patients risk of heart attacks and strokes.
