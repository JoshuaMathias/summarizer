Roh has asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's main spy agency, to launch a "thorough" investigation into the case.
South Korea's spy agency publicly apologized Friday for illegally wiretapping telephone calls years ago, revealed by the leakage of a taped 1997 conversation of an alleged payment by the Samsung Group to presidential candidates.
The scandal, dubbed the "X-files" by South Korean media, surfaced in July after revelations of a 1997 wiretapped phone conversation between Hong and Lee Hak-soo, who purportedly discussed providing illicit campaign funds to candidates in the presidential race, won by former dissident Kim Dae-jung.
