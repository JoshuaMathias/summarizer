Two weeks after the former Hillsborough teacher Debra Lafave avoided prison with a plea deal on charges she had sex with a 14-year-old student, an Ocala judge has put that agreement in jeopardy.
Hillsborough prosecutors said the deal would cover charges against the former Greco Middle School teacher in both Hillsborough and Marion counties.
Lafave was sentenced in Hillsborough County, where Tampa is located, to three years of house arrest and seven years probation after pleading guilty Nov. 22 to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery for having sex with the boy in a classroom and her home.
