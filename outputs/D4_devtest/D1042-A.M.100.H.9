Lynndie England on Monday pled guilty to charges of abusing Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison but told a court martial she did not believe she was doing wrong when photographed holding a leash on a naked inmate.
If the plea agreement was accepted by the military judge, a jury of officers and soldiers would decide her punishment following a sentencing hearing.
Colonel James Pohl halted court-martial proceedings Wednesday after Charles Graner, the alleged ringleader in the abuse scandal, testified that he had ordered Private Lynndie England to hold the leash.
