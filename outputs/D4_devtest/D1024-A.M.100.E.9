KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir on Friday recalled Sudan's diplomats from Washington to protest the U.S. missile strike on a factory in the Sudanese capital a day earlier.
President Clinton ordered the attack on the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. on Thursday on grounds the factory was producing precursors for the deadly VX chemical weapon.
Clinton said the missiles hit terrorist camps in Afghanistan run by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire blamed by Washington for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and a factory linked to bin Laden in Sudan.
