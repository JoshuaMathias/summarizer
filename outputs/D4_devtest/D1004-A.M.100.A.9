Australia will provide transport for relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea (PNG) following Friday's tsunami tragedy.
PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A tsunami spawned by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake crashed into Papua New Guinea's north coast, crushing villages and killing nearly 600 people, officials said Sunday.
Romme, who spoke with the Australian Associated Press by telephone from his bed at Aitape's Raihu Health Center, broke two fingers and injured his ribs and a shoulder when the 23-foot (7-meter) wave hurled him into a coconut tree and then into the Sissano lagoon.
