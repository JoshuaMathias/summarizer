Obesity is number one health threat associated with nutrition in Kuwait, Director of Food and Nutrition Department of the Ministry of health Fawzia Al-Awadi said in a recent study.
The fat and fatter trend has initiated more research into obesity than ever, especially in light of another group of findings linking extra weight to myriad serious health problems, including heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes and even some forms of cancer.
The percentage of American adults who are overweight or obese has risen from about 43 percent in the early 1960s to about 55 percent today.
