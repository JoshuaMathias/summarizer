The products, which were distributed nationwide and to foreign countries including Russia and South Korea by Thorn Apple Valley's Forrest City plant, may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced.
Products from the Bil Mar plant, for example, are distributed all over the United States.
The plant on Dec. 22 recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and lunch meats sold under a variety of names -- the largest meat recall ever -- because of suspected contamination with a rare strain of the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes.
