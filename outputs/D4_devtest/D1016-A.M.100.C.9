JAKARTA (JP): The government has launched an investigation into corruption under former president Soeharto but has no plans to specifically target the former Indonesian leader, Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro told a packed news conference here yesterday.
The faction's spokesman Djuhad Mahja told reporters that they finally agreed with the decree on anti-corruption, collusion and nepotism because the faction's proposal had been accommodated in it.
Habibie Monday instructed Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib to study intensively all the data provided by the U.S. Time magazine on the alleged wealth of former President Soeharto and his family abroad.
