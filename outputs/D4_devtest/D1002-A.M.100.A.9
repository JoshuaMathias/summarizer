Four white police officers were charged with murder Wednesday for killing an unarmed African immigrant in a hail of 41 bullets -- a shooting that has led to months of protests and a painful examination of police tactics and race relations.
Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy left the courthouse without comment.
An appellate court ordered the trial of the four officers accused of killing Amadou Diallo to be moved to Albany County, ruling on Thursday that a fair trial would be impossible in the Bronx because of ``the public clamor'' about the case.
