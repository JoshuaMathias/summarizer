Dutch politicians and commentators were united Tuesday in their condemnation of the murder, in broad daylight on an Amsterdam street, of controversial filmmaker Theo van Gogh and called for calm together with representatives of the Dutch Muslim community.
Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende appealed for calm.
The prosecutor charged seven suspects with ties to Islamic groups in the Netherlands, including the alleged murderer, with involvement in a conspiracy over the killing of Van Gogh and with plotting to kill Dutch liberal politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, but late Friday a judge ruled that two of the suspects should be released.
