Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at least 10 people were injured in what he called one of New York City's worst construction accidents.
The investigation into the accident continued Monday while workers recovered three more bodies from the rubble of a four-story town house on East 50th Street that was demolished when a section of the toppling crane slammed into it.
Since Saturday's collapse of a towering construction crane on the East Side of Manhattan, attention has understandably focused on the central and spectacular details, on the lives lost, the 22-story crane that toppled, the building that was demolished.
