French bank BNP Paribas has estimated its risk exposure to hedge funds managed by arrested Wall Street trader Bernard Madoff could lead to euro350 million ($466.9 million) in losses.
Madoff's sons, Andrew and Mark, and his brother, Peter, all occupied senior positions at his firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, whose assets were frozen after Bernard Madoff told law enforcement agents on Thursday that he had defrauded investors of up to $50 billion.
Ponzi schemes are a classic form of financial fraud, in which returns to would-be investors are paid with money contributed by new victims.
