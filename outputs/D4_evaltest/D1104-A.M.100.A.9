There were reports of an unknown number of cats and dogs suffering kidney failure and 10 pet deaths as Menu Foods of Toronto ordered a recall of 60 million containers of wet dog and cat food.
A federal investigation is focusing on wheat gluten as the likely source of contamination that sparked a recall last Friday of 60 million cans and pouches of the suspect food, said Stephen F. Sundlof, the Food and Drug Administration's top veterinarian.
Menu Foods manufactures products for brand-name companies including Eukanuba, Iams and Science Diet, as well as some store brands.
