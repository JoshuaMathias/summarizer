A rocket-propelled grenade struck the U.S. Embassy early Friday, causing limited damage and no injuries, but reviving fears of a resurgence of far-left Greek militant groups that carried out deadly strikes over three decades.
Public Order Vyron Polydoras said police were examining two claims of responsibility for Friday's attack by a new group called Revolutionary Struggle, which first appeared in 2003.
Greece's governing conservatives on Tuesday sharply criticized the country's privacy protection agency over restrictions blocking police access to camera footage of a rocket attack last week on the U.S. embassy in Athens.
