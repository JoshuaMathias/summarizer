A Hong Kong-registered oil tanker leaked 10,810 tons, or 66,000 barrels, of crude oil off South Korea's stormy west coast on Friday, officials said, in what was estimated to be the nation's largest maritime oil spill.
Mallipo, about 150 kilometers (95 miles) southwest of Seoul, is one of the hardest-hit areas from the oil spill, which occurred Friday when a crane-carrying barge slammed into a supertanker, punching holes and causing it to release 66,000 barrels (10.5 million liters; 2.7 million gallons) of oil into the ocean.
Seagulls black turned black and fish farms were threatened along the coast.
