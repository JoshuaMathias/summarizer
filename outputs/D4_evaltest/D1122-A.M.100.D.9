The eight-lane Interstate 35W bridge, a major Minneapolis artery, was in the midst of repairs when the bridge buckled during the evening rush hour Wednesday.
Minnesota state officials were warned as early as 1990 that the freeway bridge that plummeted into the Mississippi River and killed at least four people was "structurally deficient," yet they relied on a strategy of patchwork fixes and stepped-up inspections.
Divers searching the debris from a deadly interstate bridge collapse -- their efforts already hazardous because of jagged metal and concrete -- faced occasional showers and thunderstorms Saturday as their grim work went on.
