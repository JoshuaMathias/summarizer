Taylor is accused of orchestrating war crimes in Sierra Leone while he was leader of neighboring West African state Liberia.
In a pre-trial hearing of the case before the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL), Taylor's lawyer Karim Khan said his client was concerned he was being "short-changed" with only two attorneys who can attend his trial against a prosecution legal team of at least 10 people.
Former Liberian president Charles Taylor, who goes on trial Monday in The Hague for war crimes in neighboring Sierra Leone, was once one of Africa's most feared warlords.
