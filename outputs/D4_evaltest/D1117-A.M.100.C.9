Defense Secretary Robert Gates named an independent review panel Friday to investigate what he called an ``unacceptable situation'' in outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and he said that some soldiers ``most directly involved'' in the problems have been removed from their positions.
A senior Pentagon official said Gates had demanded Harvey's resignation because he was displeased that Harvey on Thursday, in dismissing Maj. Gen. George W. Weightman as the commander of Walter Reed, had temporarily named Lt. Gen. Kevin Kiley to take command.
The Post detailed squalid conditions and bureaucratic problems that plague outpatient care.
