Lake Mead, the vast reservoir for the Colorado River water that sustains the fast-growing cities of Phoenix and Las Vegas, could lose water faster than previously thought and run dry within 13 years, according to a new study by scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
After several years of drought, runoff on the upper Colorado River Basin is expected to be above average, as the snowpack was 22 percent above normal, when measured at its peak in April, according to the Bureau of Reclamation, which manages dams and water supplies.
