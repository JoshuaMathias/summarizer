Virginia Tech authorities and the police are investigating the identities of those killed as well as the gunman in the campus shooting rampage, a Virginia Tech spokeswoman told Xinhua on Monday.
Here is the text of e-mails sent by Virginia Tech to students, faculty members, parents and others on the university e-mail list.
However, another police officer later denied any suggestion that the suspicious male may probably be Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people and wounded 25 others before committing suicide in Virginia Tech on April 16, making it the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history.
