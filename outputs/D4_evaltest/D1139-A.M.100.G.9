NAIROBI, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi Arabian-owned oil tanker, the largest vessel ever seized, loaded with crude and carrying 25 crew members off the Kenyan coast, a regional maritime official said on Monday.
The U.S. Navy said the MV Sirius Star was seized far off the coast of Kenya on Saturday and that the bandits were taking the ship to a Somali port known as a hub of pirate activity.
Warships patrolling off Somalia have succeeded in stopping some pirate attacks as they happen.
