So those who knew Charlie Roberts were in a state of shock Monday when authorities named him as the suicidal gunman who shot a classroom full of girls, execution style, in a tiny Amish schoolhouse.
Charles Carl Roberts IV revealed to his family in notes he left behind and in a cell phone call from inside the West Nickel Mines Amish School that he was tormented by memories of molesting two young relatives 20 years ago.
It was the first in a series of funerals Thursday for victims of the West Nickel Mines Amish School shooting.
