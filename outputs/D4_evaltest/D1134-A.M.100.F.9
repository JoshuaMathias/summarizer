Trials showing that male circumcision more than halves the risk of HIV infection are published in The Lancet on Friday, giving the seal of approval to calls for circumcision to be cautiously launched as an AIDS prevention strategy.
The trials, conducted in Kenya and Uganda and earlier in South Africa, found that men who were uncircumcised were twice as likely to catch the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) compared with circumcised counterparts.
The top priority in Africa should be getting people basic health care and not just dealing with the HIV/AIDS pandemic, an African Union commissioner said.
