Eight more people were killed in flooding in three districts of Bangladesh on Monday as the overall flood situation worsened in the country's northern and northeastern districts, local media reported Tuesday.
The toll from floods in Bangladesh jumped Thursday to 54 people dead, with more than five million others displaced, after monsoon rains and Himalayan snowmelt caused rivers to overflow.
Chief Advisor of Bangladesh caretaker government Dr Fakhruddin Ahmed and Chief of the Army Staff General Moeen Ahmed Saturday visited the worst affected northwestern Siraganj and central Manikganj district and distributed relief goods among the people.
