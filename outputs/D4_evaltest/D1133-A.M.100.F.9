British Prime Minister Gordon Brown confirmed Saturday that an incident in which a blazing jeep rammed into a terminal at Scotland's Glasgow airport was "an attack", as he justified raising the security threat level to "critical".
Police searched homes near Glasgow International Airport on Sunday in connection with a fiery attack on the main terminal and a foiled car bomb plot in London.
Early Sunday, police arrested two people -- a 26-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman -- on a major highway in central England in a joint swoop by officers from London and Birmingham.
