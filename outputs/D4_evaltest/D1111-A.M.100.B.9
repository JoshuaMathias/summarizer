A teenager at a school in Finland went on the rampage Wednesday, shooting dead seven classmates and the headmistress, having first signalled his intentions in a video posted on the YouTube Internet site.
Police identified 18-year-old Pekka-Eric Auvinen as the killer and said he was in a "critical condition" after turning the gun on himself following the massacre at Jokela High School in the small town of Tuusula.
The Jokela school shooting in southern Finland last week has spawned a number of threats against other schools, Finnish daily "Helsingin Sanomat" reported Wednesday.
