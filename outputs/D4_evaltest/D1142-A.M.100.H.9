Serial blasts rocked crowded market areas and near a Hanuman temple in the walled tourist city.
Indian police on Wednesday arrested two men after eight near-simultaneous bombings killed 63 people and wounded 216 in the Rajasthan tourist city of Jaipur, the state's chief minister said.
Eight bombs went off within minutes of each other in crowded markets close to several Hindu temples in what police said was a terror attack on the city 260 kilometres (160 miles) west of New Delhi, India's capital.
Pakistan-based Islamic militants and fighting against Indian rule in Kashmir are usually blamed for such attacks.
