U.S. government health officials said Friday they are reviewing whether popular medicines like Tylenol Plus Cold & Cough and Infant Triaminic Thin Strips are safe and effective in treating children's colds and coughs.
The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, an industry trade group that has consistently defended the safety of pediatric cough and cold medicines, recommended in its own 156-page safety review, also released Friday, that the FDA consider mandatory warning labels saying that they should not be used in children younger than two.
The drugs had been given by well-meaning parents to relieve nasal stuffiness and other minor symptoms.
