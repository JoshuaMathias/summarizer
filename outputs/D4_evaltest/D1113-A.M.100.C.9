An international effort to halt the illegal killing of elephants for their ivory tusks has all but collapsed in most of Africa, leaving officials and advocates alarmed about the survival of the species.
Director general Lewis Saiwana of the Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) described as a misrepresentation the reports that it has submitted the proposal.
CITES banned the international ivory trade in 1989, but since 1997 has authorised Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe -- where it judges the elephant populations to be strong -- to carry out occasional sales of between 10 and 50 tonnes each time.
