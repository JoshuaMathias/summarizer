The trial opens Thursday of 29 mostly Moroccan suspects charged with involvement in the Madrid train bomb attacks in March 2004, which killed 191 people and injured 1,824 in the worst terror strike Spain has ever known.
Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, the first of 29 suspects to take the stand in the trial of the 2004 Madrid train bombings which opened Thursday, is considered by Spanish prosecutors to be one of four masterminds of the deadly attacks.
Prosecutors claim Youssef Belhadj is the man seen in a video found near a Madrid mosque two days after the train bombings.
