Chronic sleep deprivation can do more than leave you short-tempered: it can also stress your heart and raise your risk of cardiovascular disease and death, according to a study released Wednesday.
A study at the University of Chicago found that participants who slept only four hours a night for two nights had an 18 percent decrease in leptin and a 28 percent increase in ghrelin.
Now scientific evidence suggests their disrupted circadian rhythms also may cause a kind of biological revolt, raising their likelihood of obesity, cancer, reproductive health problems, mental illness and gastrointestinal disorders.
