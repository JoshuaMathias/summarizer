Rescue ships collected scores of bloated corpses Monday from seas close to where an Indonesian ferry sank in the Java Sea, but search teams also spotted survivors on life rafts and dropped food and water to them, officials said.
The "Senopati Nusantara" (Archipelago Commander) carrying around 600 people was en route from Kumai on Borneo island to Semarang in Central Java when it sank in a storm Friday night.
Ahmad Rifai thought he was going to die as huge waves hurled his life raft around the Java Sea following last week's ferry sinking in central Indonesia.
