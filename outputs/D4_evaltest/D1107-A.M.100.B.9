China and the United States will sign a memorandum of understanding on food safety by the end of this year enabling the two sides to resolve food safety issues more effectively, said a senior Chinese quality control official on Wednesday.
A delegation led by a vice-ministerial-level official of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was set to come to Beijing in August to discuss the MOU with Chinese food safety regulators, said Li Yuanping, an official in charge of the safety of import and export products at the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ).
