The report by Conservation International found 10 percent of the Caribbean's 62 spectacular reef-building corals -- one of the sea's most spectacular natural resources -- are under threat and candidates for "critically endangered" designations.
But increasingly, divers and snorkelers are swimming over bleached hunks of coral devastated by shore runoff or overfishing.From the South Pacific to the Caribbean, coral reefs -- which are among the most delicate of marine ecosystems -- are bearing the brunt of climate change and other human-driven activities -- including coastal development, deforestation, and unrestricted tourism.
