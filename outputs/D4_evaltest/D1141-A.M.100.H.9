China has reversed soil erosion over an area of 960,000 square kilometers, or 10 percent of its total land area, sources with the Ministry of Water Resources said on Thursday.
Soil erosion is deteriorating in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as excessive herding and farming have outpaced the government's conservation efforts.
Fourteen conservation projects will be launched, covering natural grassland and wildlife protection, the establishment of nature reserves, the control of desertification and soil erosion, and geological disasters prevention, said Zhang Yongze, director of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Department of Environment Protection.
