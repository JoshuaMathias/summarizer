The worst attack in years on the Internet's infrastructure, which slowed traffic but failed to bring down the Web, used infected computers around the world as "zombies," security experts said Wednesday.
VeriSign Inc., which manages the ".com" and ".net" domain names registry and ensures Internet users can reach those locations, said it will spend more than $100 million (euro77 million) in a massive infrastructure upgrade to combat a new wave of computer attacks and manage a surge in online activity.
Hackers usually conduct "phishing" attacks to steal personal information.
The Internet real-name system has evolved constantly in South Korea.
