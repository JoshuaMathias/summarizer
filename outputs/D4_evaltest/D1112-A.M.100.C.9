Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan pounded Juan Manuel Alvarez for details about threats he admitted making to kill or injure his then-estranged wife, his cousin and others before he parked his SUV on railroad tracks in Glendale, causing the Jan. 26, 2005, collision.
During the sentencing hearing, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge William R. Pounders told Alvarez that he was not convinced.
After convicting Juan Alvarez of first-degree murder and recommending a life sentence without parole, some jurors in the Metrolink train derailment case last month said they really didn't think Alvarez intended to kill anyone.
