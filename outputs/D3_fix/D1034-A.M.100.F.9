Amphibians' permeable skin and dual existence on land and in water make them "canaries in the coal mine," early indicators that pollution, climate change, and overall degradation of the environment may eventually threaten human life, according to zoologists.
The survey, published online by the journal Science, studied the 5,743 known amphibian species and found that at least 1,856 of them face extinction, more than 100 species may already be extinct, and 43 percent are in a population decline -- many for unknown reasons.
Researchers confirmed 35 new species of frog in Sri Lanka's dwindling rain forest over the past decade but also found that 17 frog species have disappeared and 11 others face imminent extinction unless their habitat is protected.
J. Alan Pounds -- resident scientist at the Tropical Science Center's Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve in Costa Rica and the study's lead author -- worked with 13 other researchers to pin down the link between rising temperatures in the tropics and the spread of the deadly chytrid fungus that has wiped out dozens of species of harlequin frogs in recent years.
