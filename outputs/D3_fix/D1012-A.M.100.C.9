Greek Defense Ministry and fire department said that the plane crashed to a mountain at about 12:20 p.m. (0920 GMT) near the coastal town of Grammatikos, about 40 kilometers north of Athens, just a few minutes before its scheduled landing time on a flight from Larnaca International Airport of Cyprus to Prague via Athens.
Oxygen masks were seen hanging in the cabin, a Greek government spokesman said.
But Fillipos Koutsaftis could not rule out that the six people were unconscious when the Helios Airways Boeing 737-300, with six crew and 115 passengers, plunged 10,400 meters (34,000 feet) Sunday into a mountainous area near the village of Grammatiko, 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Athens.
The Greek government said the crews of two F-16 fighter jets that flew beside the jetliner before it went down Sunday saw its co-pilot slumped over the controls and its pilot missing from the cockpit.
One month after Greece's worst air accident, a conclusive explanation of what caused a Cypriot Helios Airways airliner to crash killing all 121 people on board still eludes investigators, but recent reports suggest pilots may have failed to respond to a cabin pressure warning.
