Alarmed by what they see as the potential for mishaps with patients taking herbal remedies for everything from depression to memory loss, anesthesiologists have begun urging people to stop taking the herbs and supplements before having surgery.
Doctors say there is growing evidence that substances like St. John's wort and ginkgo biloba may have dangerous interactions with the variety of drugs used to anesthetize patients during surgery.
While the FDA can alert consumers to products that could be dangerous, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 limits the agency's latitude in regulating supplements.
Two years ago, in response to reports of adverse reactions, the Food and Drug Administration proposed restricting doses of ephedra to 8 milligrams at a time and 24 milligrams a day, and prohibiting the addition of caffeine to ephedrine products.
Gyllenhaal said the study, published in the June issue of Sleep Medicine Reviews, found reason for doctors to be concerned about ephedra because of the disorders that it could make worse, including high blood pressure and diabetes, besides possibly unintended effects on sleep.
