By the end of 2004, arrow bamboo, the favorite food of giants, had blossomed on 7,420 hectares at the Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve in southern Gansu Province, a major habitat of pandas in China, according to a recent survey conducted by the nature reserve administration.
Experts with the Shaanxi Provincial Wildlife Management Station confirmed that the dung was left by an adult giant panda.
China has applied to the United Nations to make giant pandas' natural habitat in southwestern Sichuan province a world heritage area to help protect the endangered species, state press reported Tuesday.
The two giant pandas at the city's zoo retired to their favorite spot under a few bushes and mated over the past two days _ the only successful natural insemination of a panda this year in the United States, officials said.
The National Zoo's female panda, Mei Xiang, gave birth early Saturday morning to a squealing cub the size of a stick of butter, and keepers say she is caring for it tenderly.
