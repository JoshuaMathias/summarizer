More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
The tsunami that took a heavy toll in human life also battered Indian Ocean coral reefs that already were in distress from pollution and global warming, possibly causing damage that will require decades to recover, experts say.
Experts say the extent of devastation caused by the giant waves has laid bare some stark realities: the plight of poor fishing-folk forced to live on the fringe to earn a living, man's folly at clearing natural coastal habitats to chase the tourism dollar, and a modern ignorance of the power of the sea.
Dozens of scuba divers are removing furniture and other debris swept into the ocean by the Dec. 26 tsunami, hoping to rescue fragile coral reefs and marine life that have long made Thailand's southern coast a top tourist destination.
