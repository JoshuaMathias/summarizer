SHANGHAI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A survey in Shanghai has revealed that one in eight people in the city suffer from overweight.
About 11 percent of national men and 14 percent of women had diabetes and the rate is expected to rise in the following years, according to the study released by UAE's medical center today.
More than half of American citizens are overweight and one out of four is obese, according to the latest issue of Science.
The fat and fatter trend has initiated more research into obesity than ever, especially in light of another group of findings linking extra weight to myriad serious health problems, including heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes and even some forms of cancer.
Hill, director of the Colorado Clinical Nutrition Research Unit at the University of Colorado, puts a preponderance of blame for fat Americans on our culture: Americans have too much food available; social and work situations encourage overeating; restaurants compete by offering bigger and bigger servings; 64-ounce Big Gulps and Thirst Busters have replaced 12-ounce bottled soda; and technology has made it possible to avoid exercise.
