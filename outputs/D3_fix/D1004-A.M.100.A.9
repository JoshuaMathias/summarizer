PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Huge sea waves set off by an earthquake crashed against Papua New Guinea's north coast, killing at least 70 people and crushing villages, the country's National Disaster Center said.
Disaster authorities said the area, about 600 kilometers (370 miles) northwest of the capital of Port Moresby, is spotted with villages consisting of homes made of jungle materials and built on beaches.
Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on PNG's north-west coast, said the tsunami, that hit the coast west of Aitape on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had almost completely destroyed another, according to an Australian Associated Press report sent Sunday from Aitape.
As Australian aid workers opened a field hospital on high ground and relief supplies began trickling in, Papua New Guinea's prime minister, Bill Skate, toured the worst-hit villages and the Sissano lagoon, choked with dead fish and hundreds of rotting human bodies.
