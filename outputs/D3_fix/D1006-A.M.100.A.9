On Wednesday, the European Medicines Agency in London announced it would review all drugs of this type.
Studies done five years ago when Celebrex and Merck & Co.'s Vioxx were approved suggest that the same mechanism that inhibits inflammation and makes the drugs easier on the stomach than traditional painkillers also blocks a substance that prevents heart problems, according to Dr. Garret FitzGerald, a University of Pennsylvania cardiologist.
The announcement comes just two weeks after Merck pulled its painkiller, Vioxx, which is in the same class of drugs as Bextra, from the market because a study showed that the risk of heart attacks doubled for patients who had taken Vioxx for 18 months or longer.
The trial results released Tuesday found that there was no statistical difference in adverse cardiovascular events between Arcoxia and diclofenac, the older pain reliever against which it was being compared.
The e-mail and meeting notes also show that Dr. David Graham, an official in the FDA's Office of Drug Safety, is seeking to begin a study of the safety of Bextra and Mobic, two arthritis pills that are similar to Vioxx.
