KUALA LUMPUR, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 20 people were taken hostage by six heavily armed men Sunday night from Sipadan island off Sabah, East Malaysia, but their motives behind the abduction are yet to be confirmed, Malaysian Police said Monday.
Muslim rebels in the Philippines who are seeking the release of militants jailed in the World Trade Center bombing case claimed responsibility Tuesday for the Malaysian kidnapping.
The 20 hostages, including foreign tourists and local resort workers, were abducted late Sunday from Malaysia's Sipadan Island by six heavily armed men and taken on two fishing boats toward the Philippines, officials said.
The Philippine Muslim extremist group Abu Sayyaf has threatened to behead some of the 21 hostages they abducted last Sunday in Malaysia because they do not want to talk with a government negotiator.
According to reports from Zamboanga City, the southern Philippines,an Abu Sayyaf spokesman told Radio Mindanao Network Friday night that Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao, is unacceptable as negotiator.
