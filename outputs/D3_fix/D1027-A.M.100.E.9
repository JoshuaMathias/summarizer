Fourteen people were dismissed Thursday as jury selection continued in the trial of a man accused of beating gay college student Matthew Shepard to death.
In December, when Cal Rerucha, the Albany County attorney, announced that he would seek the death penalty in both cases, Skaggs called the choice ``politically motivated,'' noting that this would be Wyoming's first capital murder trial in 20 years.
President Clinton plans to endorse a bill Tuesday that would expand federal hate crime laws to include offenses based on sexual orientation, White House officials said.
Skaggs is the defense attorney and Rerucha the prosecutor in the trial of Russell Henderson, who is charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in the fatal beating Oct. 6 of gay university student Matthew Shepard.
Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar last October, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to a fence in the cold.
