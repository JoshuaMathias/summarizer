The mother of a 14-year-old middle school student says she believes the case of a former teacher accused of having sex with her son should not go to trial.
The victim, who had sex with Tampa teacher Debra Lafave, has suffered extreme anxiety from the intense media coverage surrounding the case, a psychiatrist who examined the boy told Circuit Court Judge Hale Stancil at the hearing Wednesday.
Lafave was sentenced in Hillsborough County, where Tampa is located, to three years of house arrest and seven years probation after pleading guilty Nov. 22 to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery for having sex with the boy in a classroom and her home.
A Florida teacher who admitted having sex several times with her 14-year-old student was freed Tuesday after prosecutors dropped sexual abuse charges to avoid calling the boy to the witness stand.
First came a Marion County judge's rejection Tuesday morning of a plea deal, a rare and controversial move that meant Lafave could face a sensational trial and as many as four decades in prison.
