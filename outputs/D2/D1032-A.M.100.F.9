Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Tuesday that it had yet to resume production on two of its platforms after a gas leak forced it to shut down operations earlier this week, cutting Norway's total oil output by 200,000 barrels per day.
More than 160 of 216 people working on a Norwegian oil platform in the North Sea were evacuated Sunday after one of the rigs became "unstable", causing a loss of output of 130,000 barrels per day, a company spokesman and rescue services said.
