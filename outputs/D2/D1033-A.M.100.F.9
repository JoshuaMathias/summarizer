South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun 
on Monday ordered the National Intelligence Service (NIS) to 
thoroughly investigate the allegation that one of the nation's 
biggest conglomerates provided huge slush funds to presidential 
candidates in 1997.
South Korea's spy agency apologized Friday for illegally recording phone
conversations involving influential figures and admitted that wiretapping
continued long after former President Kim Dae-jung ordered an end to it in
1998.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung was
hospitalized Wednesday, his office said.
