Storm-weary residents in the Bahamas \nbraced for a brush with Hurricane Floyd as it swelled and powered \nup to a major storm, packing winds of up to 145 mph on Sunday.
As Hurricane Floyd neared the strength of a \nCategory 5 storm today and headed west, thousands of coastal \nresidents were ordered to evacuate and NASA began moving workers \nout of the low-lying Kennedy Space Center.
Most of those counties don't have population\ninland, they sit right on the coast, so it's going to be pretty\ndevastating as far as who is going to get hit.
