As Hurricane Floyd neared the strength of a Category 5 storm today and headed west, thousands of coastal residents were ordered to evacuate and NASA began moving workers out of the low-lying Kennedy Space Center.
The prospect of an extremely powerful, coast-hugging hurricane ``was a scenario that ever since I've been here I've hoped I'd never see,'' Witt said Monday, noting that the destruction could cover ``not just one area, it's the whole coastline and the pounding it's going to take.''
