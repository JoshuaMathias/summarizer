   WASHINGTON - Wherever Hurricane Floyd hits, the federal agency
responsible for emergencies says it won't be as tardy as it was
after Hurricane Andrew, seven years ago.This could be the storm FEMA Director James Lee
Witt has been dreading since taking office six years ago: a
catastrophic hurricane that hugs the coastline from Florida to the
Carolinas, causing massive damage along a swath hundreds of miles
long.A voluntary evacuation of heavily-populated
barrier islands and low-lying areas east of Ga. 17 could become
mandatory by noon today as Hurricane Floyd showed signs of swinging
closer to coastal Georgia.
