Mount St. Helens, the volcano that blew its top with cataclysmic
force in 1980, erupted for the first time in 18 years Friday,
belching a huge column of white steam and ash after days of
rumblings.
Pam Morret and her husband, Lynn, missed the big eruption of Mount
St. Helens in 1980.
Government scientists raised the alert level for Mount St. Helens
after its second steam eruption in two days was followed by a
powerful tremor.
Just before noon on Friday, seismometers at the Cascades Volcano
Observatory in Vancouver, Wash., wiggled in a familiar pattern.
