Helios airline officials refused to release the passenger list\nbut said 48 of the passengers were "youth travelers" bound\nfor Prague, Czech Republic, after a stopover in Athens.
A piece of the tail and a wheel from the landing gear were\nintact and recognizable.
After the plane lost contact\nwith air traffic controllers "for more than an hour," said\nIoannis Pantazaratos, head of the air traffic control tower at\nEleftherios Venizelos International Airport, "we had no idea who was\nflying the plane.
But that the plane was not shot down\nby armed F-16 jet fighters suggests that this may not\nhave been a terrorist attack.
