Beef sold in Bulgaria since June 2004 has not been certified free of
mad cow disease because the test used is not officially recognised by
the European Union, mad-cow expert Roumen Valchovski said Friday.
Medical tests on a young Irishman have confirmed that he is suffering
from variant CJD, the human form of mad cow disease, a Dublin
hospital spokesman said on Wednesday.
Department of Health officials said Friday
that there is no timetable for reintroducing the importation of U.S.
beef to Taiwan after America was declared an area affected by mad cow
disease late last year.
