His opponents have dismissed the charge, saying he got sick after gorging himself on bad sushi and too much alcohol.
In an Oct. 7 statement to Ukraine's parliament, Volodymyr Sivkovych, chairman of an ad hoc commission that looked into Yushchenko's illness, reported on the opposition leader's activities the day before he became ill. On the evening of Sept. 5, Yushchenko first had dinner at the summer house of a businessman, where sushi was served that had not been refrigerated for more than three hours, Sivkovych said.
