The Food Standards Agency said it was working with the food industry and local authorities to make sure that all the affected products are removed from the shelves and urged members of the public who have them in their cupboards to contact the store where they were bought for a refund.
The director of Food Standard Agency (FSA) David Statham said in a statement that "local authorities across the country have visited a number of premises to look at records and take samples," adding that "this is a major investigation".
