A top official with China's environmental watchdog said Thursday that the
company overseeing a chemical plant where an explosion spewed lethal chemicals
into a river in the country's northeast should be held responsible for the
pollution.
China's State Environmental 
Protection Administration (SEPA) said here on Wednesday that the 
Songhua River in northeast China suffered a major water pollution 
incident owing to the explosion of a petrochemical plant at the 
upper reaches.
Songhua River will carry poisonous 
substances to Harbin, a major city in northeast China, at round 
5:00 a.m. Thursday, an official said at a press conference 
Wednesday afternoon.
