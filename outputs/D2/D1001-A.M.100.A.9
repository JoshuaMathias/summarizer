Columbine High School junior Matt Wells \ntook time out from the grieving world around him to crack a smile, \nchew on a wad of sunflower seeds and talk a little baseball.
The day that Columbine High School \nstudents are to return to class has been delayed because so many \nhave been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 \nmassacre, an administrator said Tuesday.
Comforting each other with ceremony and \nsong, Columbine High School's mourners turned a strip-mall parking \nlot into an arena of grief and promised each other they would reach \npast their pain.
