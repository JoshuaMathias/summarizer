Who's killing the great bears of Montana?
The Bush administration on Tuesday is to take the
first step toward removing Yellowstone's grizzly bears, a living icon
of the American West, from the nation's endangered species list.
Grizzly bears in areas surrounding Yellowstone National Park would be removed
from the endangered species list under a proposal to be announced next week,
officials said.
Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the
endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the U.S.
Department of Interior said Tuesday.
Grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park can weigh up to 600
pounds.
