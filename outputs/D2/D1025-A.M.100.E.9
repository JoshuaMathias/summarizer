Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing to\nremove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list\nlater this year.
It is considered likely\nthat the states would allow the animal to be hunted,\nbut in terms of management, Norton said, "the reality is\nthere\'s very little change.
Their range\nencompasses Yellowstone, Grand Teton National Park and nearby lands in\nWyoming, Montana and Idaho.
The law protects the bears in Yellowstone,\npart of Grand Teton and in a circle of land outside, known as the\n``primary recovery area.
Some pose a dire threat," Mattson said.\n"We won\'t likely have any good options for those.
