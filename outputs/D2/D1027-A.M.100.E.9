One of two men arrested in the beating \ndeath of gay college student Matthew Shepard merely watched while \nthe other man pistol-whipped Shepard and left him to die, a defense \nattorney said Wednesday as jury selection began.
The day before one of the men accused of \nkilling her son was going on trial in Wyoming, the mother of gay \ncollege student Matthew Shepard lobbied tearfully for hate-crime \nlaws that could deter future acts of violence.
As he said this, Matthew \nShepard's mother, Judy, who was in the last row of the courtroom, \nslowly looked down.
