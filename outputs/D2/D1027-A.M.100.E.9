the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard 
will begin with jury selection March 24.In the weeks after the beating death of gay  
student Matthew Shepard, this college town found itself portrayed 
as backwards, homophobic, an outpost of Wild West-style violence 
and small-mindedness.The day before one of the men accused of  
killing her son was going on trial in Wyoming, the mother of gay 
college student Matthew Shepard lobbied tearfully for hate-crime 
laws that could deter future acts of violence.
