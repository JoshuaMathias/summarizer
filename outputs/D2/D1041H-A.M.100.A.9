Only about 30 percent of the world's coral reefs are healthy, down
from 41 percent two years ago, according to a study released Monday
that lists global warming as the top threat.
Discarded utility poles were
submerged in waters off Nanliao Port in the northern Taiwan county of
Hsinchu Friday to create artificial reefs as part of the government's
fishery resources conservation efforts.
For some time, scientists have predicted that the world's coral reefs
will be among the first ecosystems to suffer devastating damage from
global warming.
Twenty percent of the world's coral reefs ``have been effectively
destroyed and show no immediate prospect of recovery.''
