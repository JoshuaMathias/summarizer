Armed tribesmen have surrounded some 300 paramilitary troops and government officials at a base in a southwestern Pakistani town where fears of fresh fighting between renegade tribesmen and troops have forced thousands of residents to flee for safety, an official said Sunday.
Abdul Samad Lasi, a senior official at Dera Bugti, said they had received reports from intelligence and security officials that more than 1,500 armed men from the dominant local Bugti tribe had taken up positions in mountains outside the town and were waiting for an order to attack government installations.
