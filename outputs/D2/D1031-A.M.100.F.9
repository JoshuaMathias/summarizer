However, some\nbiologists speculated that marine mammals such as whales and dolphins\nswimming near shore when the tsunami struck may have sensed the\nstrange seas and headed for deeper waters, where the giant waves were\nbarely noticeable.
They can't immediately\nreturn to fishing because their boats were destroyed and few fish are found\nclose to the shore.
Meanwhile, corals, which only grow a\nfraction of an inch each year, may be excreting mucus as a defensive\nmechanism against the mud -- "expensive in terms of energy (that)\nweakens the coral," e-mailed Marco Noordeloos of the WorldFish\nCenter.
The program aims to involve fishermen's\nfamilies in growing and preserving forests.
