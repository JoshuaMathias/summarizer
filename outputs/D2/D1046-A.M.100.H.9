Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Wednesday that his country would provide 1 billion Australian dollars (about 764 million US dollars) in loans and grants to assist Indonesia in its rebuilding after the Dec. 26 earthquake-tsunami disaster.
The official news agency BSS Monday quoted the sources at the Department of Relief and Rehabilitation as saying that the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) would airlift a part of the food to Sumatra immediately after availability of aircraft and that the rest would be shipped for Sri Lanka in the next couple of days.
