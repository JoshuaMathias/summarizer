KUALA LUMPUR, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 20 people were taken hostage by six heavily armed men Sunday night from Sipadan island off Sabah, East Malaysia, but their motives behind the abduction are yet to be confirmed, Malaysian Police said Monday.
''Our group is behind the abduction of the foreigners (in Malaysia) and there are still a lot of surprises for the government if they won't listen to us,'' Abu Sayyaf spokesman Abu Ahmad said in an interview over local radio station DXRZ.
