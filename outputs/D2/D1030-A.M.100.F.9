Annette Dickinson, director of scientific and\nregulatory affairs for the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a\ntrade organization for producers of dietary supplements, said a\nconsortium of associations submitted a document of manufacturing\nstandards to the Food and Drug Administration two years ago.\nAlthough such a standard would say nothing about an herb's safety\nor effectiveness, it would result in reliable methods that the\nindustry would have to use to assure the identity and quality of\nits products.
Under the 1994 law, consumers have no\nassurance that an herbal product contains what the label says it\ndoes or that it is free from harmful contaminants.
