New Zealand is seeking all 
options including a possible legal fight against Japan's plan to 
kill endangered humpback whales, local media said Monday.
Australia strongly opposes Japanese 
plans to expand its whaling catch in Antarctic waters but will not 
try to board Japanese whaling ships there because it could be 
accused of piracy, Attorney General Philip Ruddock said Saturday.
Australia said Tuesday it was engaged in 
an unprecedented diplomatic campaign to disuade Japan from trying to 
escalate its killing of whales.
