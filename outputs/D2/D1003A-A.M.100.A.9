China will soon finish building its 
first blood bank for pandas, which will assist researchers in 
studying the endangered animals' blood types and chances of 
accepting blood transfusions, state media said Friday.
About 100 giant pandas in 
northwest China's Gansu Province are suffering from hunger because
large tracts of arrow bamboo have bloomed and died.
Forest coverage in southwestern 
Sichuan Province has increased to 27.94 percent from 24.3 percent 
in 2003, making the region, a major habitat of giant pandas, a 
greener home, according to the local government.
