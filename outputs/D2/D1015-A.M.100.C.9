Yunnan plans to achieve widespread improvement in its environment by the first decade of the next century, with forest coverage rate hitting 30 percent, and the area of natural reserve zones accounting for eight percent of the province's total land.
This allows the tropical rain forest to harbor many rare and valuable flora and fauna that are on the verge of extinction elsewhere, Han says, but because it's between a torrid zone and a subtropical zone, it is more fragile than those at the equator.
