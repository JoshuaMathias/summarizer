Norwegian oil group Statoil on Tuesday 
requested permission to gradually resume production on two platforms 
in the North Sea that were shut down last November due to a gas 
leak, targeting a production of 100,000 barrels per day in the short 
term.
Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Cos. said Friday that it shut down its 140,000-barrel
per day Draugen offshore oil field because of damage to its oil-loading
equipment.
Statoil ASA said Tuesday it expects to restart its Snorre A offshore
petroleum platform later this week, almost a month after a natural
gas leak shut down operations.
