The New South Wales state government brought charges against the ranch owner, who employed 23-year-old Daniel Croker, convicting and fining the company 95,000 Australian dollars (US$72,000; euro56,000) last month for breaches of safety, including failure to provide the horseman with an equestrian helmet.
The founder of a San Diego-based company called Full90 said he has sold 100,000 headgear, which resemble an enlarged headband, weigh less than 2 ounces, and cover the forehead, temples and occipital bone in back of the head.
