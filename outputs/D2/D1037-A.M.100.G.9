Some\nofficials in Maryland look to the Asian oyster as a potential\nreplacement for the native oyster, which has been decimated by disease\nand pollution.
That is\nbecause Chesapeake watermen pulled an all-time low of about 25,000\nbushels of oysters from the bay last year, compared with 80,000 in\n1993 -- and a staggering 15 million back in the glory days of 1885.\nFrom 1920 to 1970, before the oyster began its rapid decline, the\nindustry contributed $65 million annually to the state of Maryland, a\nfigure that didn't include the tourism it attracted.
We see the old generation that\'s passed on, and there\'s no\nyounger one to take their place.
