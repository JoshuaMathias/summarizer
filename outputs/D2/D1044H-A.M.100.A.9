Britain's Food Standards Agency on 
Friday issued an urgent  warning advising people not to eat more 
than 350 food products inadvertently contaminated with an illegal 
dye.
Cyprus health services have advised
people not to eat foods imported from Britain that have 
contaminated an illegal dye named Sudan I, local press reported 
Tuesday.
Sudan I, a potentially cancer-
causing colorant, is the latest target for China's product quality
watchdogs after the disclosure that the red dye has tainted 
hundreds of food items in Britain, Thursday's China Daily reported.
