Ukrainian presidential hopeful Viktor Yushchenko
was poisoned with dioxin, most likely intentionally, doctors in Vienna
who have been struggling to diagnose his mystery illness confirmed
Saturday.
The illness that disfigured the face of opposition
presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko resulted from poisoning by
the toxic substance dioxin, which might have been placed deliberately
in his food, Austrian doctors who treated him told reporters in Vienna
on Saturday.
The Ukrainian prosecutor-general's office
announced Sunday it had reopened an investigation into allegations
that presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned, after
doctors in Austria confirmed he had ingested dioxin.
