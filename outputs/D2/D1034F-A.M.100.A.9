Amphibians are experiencing a precipitous decline
across the globe, according to the first comprehensive world survey of
the creatures, which include frogs, toads and salamanders.
Almost 150 species of amphibians have apparently gone extinct and
at least one-third of the rest are facing imminent threats that could
soon wipe them out, according to a worldwide assessment by scientists
published Thursday.
After six-and-a-half years of mending 
broken legs and treating disease, Australia's only frog hospital is 
closing its doors due to a lack of funding.
About one third of amphibians are under threat of extinction,
according to researchers who carried out a global census.
