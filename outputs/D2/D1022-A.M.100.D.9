Australia strongly opposes Japanese 
plans to expand its whaling catch in Antarctic waters but will not 
try to board Japanese whaling ships there because it could be 
accused of piracy, Attorney General Philip Ruddock said Saturday.
Australia said Tuesday it was engaged in 
an unprecedented diplomatic campaign to disuade Japan from trying to 
escalate its killing of whales.
Tokyo will not yield to foreign pressure 
seeking to stop it from whaling, a fisheries official said Tuesday 
after Australia stepped up a campaign against Japan's annual hunt in 
the name of scientific research.
