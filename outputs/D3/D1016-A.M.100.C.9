Article four of the decree states that efforts to eradicate corruption, collusion and nepotism must be made indiscriminately upon any state officials, former state officials, their families and cronies as well as private businessmen, business tycoons and former president Soeharto.
The project had caused the country losses of 1.55 billion U.S. dollars.
Habibie Monday instructed Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib to study intensively all the data provided by the U.S. Time magazine on the alleged wealth of former President Soeharto and his family abroad.
Indonesian former president Soeharto will not come to the Attorney General Office on Monday to undergo an investigation on corruption cases due to health reasons, chief of Soeharto's legal defender team Juan Felix Tampubolon said here on Friday.
