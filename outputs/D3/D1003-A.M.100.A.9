The two giant pandas at the city's zoo retired to their favorite spot under a few bushes and mated over the past two days _ the only successful natural insemination of a panda this year in the United States, officials said.
Doctors at a leading hospital in northwest China say Thursday's operation on a paralyzed giant panda has been a success but they cannot tell at the moment when it will be on its feet again, or whether it ever will.
The birth was seen as a hopeful sign for efforts to revive the endangered species.
