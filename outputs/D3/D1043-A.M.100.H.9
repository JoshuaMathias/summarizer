Saudi Arabia on Tuesday rejected a French demand for an international investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying Lebanon is an independent country.
The crowd began massing quietly in front of Rafik Hariri's mansion in the early dawn hours Wednesday as Lebanon prepared to bury him and the six bodyguards who were killed with him in a bomb blast on Monday.
Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese mourners gathered at the Mohamed Al Amin Mosque in the capital Beirut on Wednesday to pay last tribute to former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri killed in a suicide car bombing on Monday.
Hariri, a popular figure to many in Lebanon and a central figure in reconstructing the country after a devastating 15-year civil war, was assassinated on Monday in an explosion that many here believe was the work of Syria, whose forces have played a dominant role in Lebanon since the 1970s.
Qordahi hoped that the Lebanese people will join hands and agree on the formation of a new government as quickly as possible in order to hold the parliamentary elections on time.
