President Roh Moo-hyun on Tuesday said he will accept the resignation of South Korea's ambassador to the United States, who is stepping down over a burgeoning scandal surrounding the East Asian country's 1997 presidential election.
South Korean prosecutors said Thurday they have secured an arrest warrant for a former intelligence official accused of leaking a taped conversation detailing a slush fund payment by the Samsung Group.
South Korea's spy agency apologized Friday for illegally recording phone conversations involving influential figures and admitted that wiretapping continued long after former President Kim Dae-jung ordered an end to it in 1998.
