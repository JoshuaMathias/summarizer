Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh, who had received threats over a controversial film he made about Islam, was shot and stabbed to death Tuesday while cycling on an Amsterdam street, officials said.
The alleged assailant, identified as having dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality, was arrested and two people were injured in a shootout with police after the attack in broad daylight early Tuesday, police said.
The prosecutor charged seven suspects with ties to Islamic groups in the Netherlands, including the alleged murderer, with involvement in a conspiracy over the killing of Van Gogh and with plotting to kill Dutch liberal politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, but late Friday a judge ruled that two of the suspects should be released.
One of them was immediately re-arrested by the Dutch immigration services because he was residing illegally in the country, a court official told ANP.
The 23-year-old arrested in connection with Van Gogh's death is the eighth suspect in what Dutch prosecutors say was a gang of young Muslim radicals who conspired to murder the filmmaker over a movie critical of Islam.
