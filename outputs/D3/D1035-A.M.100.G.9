Thursday's independent report by the Institute of Medicine appears to offer no new evidence that would affect benefits for Vietnam War veterans or their offspring, although the Department of Veterans Affairs said the study will be valuable for further research.
The rates of illness among the 1,000 veterans were compared to those of 1,300 other Air Force veterans who also served in the war but had no involvement in the spraying of agent orange, a herbicide that was used to defoliate trees and remove cover for North Vietnamese soldiers and Communist guerrillas in the south.
