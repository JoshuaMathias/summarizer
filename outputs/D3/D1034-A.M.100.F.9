Isolated reports of silent forests and empty streams began to circulate about three decades ago, but the latest assessment is the first to provide a complete snapshot of a global decline in the diversity of frogs, salamanders, newts, and worm-like caecilians, and to show that they are at greater risk than both birds and mammals.
In a decade-long study, a Wildlife Heritage Trust team found evidence of 35 new frog species, confirming the Indian Ocean island as the world's number one spot for frogs, with more than 200 known species, ahead even of rainforest-rich, biodiverse Costa Rica, Pethiyagoda told AFP.
