David and Wanda turned in Theodore Kaczynski last year after authorities had mounted an unsuccessful 18-year search for the Unabomber.
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The trial of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski in Sacramento, California, is on hold following a surprise meeting with the judge and his lawyers, reportedly to air complaints about his defense, media reports said.
Ever since his brother's arrest in April 1996, David Kaczynski has said that he did not go to the FBI out of interest in the reward, which was offered in October 1993, but out of concern that more people could be hurt.
