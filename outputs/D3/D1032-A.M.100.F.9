More than 160 of 216 people working on a Norwegian oil platform in the North Sea were evacuated Sunday after one of the rigs became "unstable", causing a loss of output of 130,000 barrels per day, a company spokesman and rescue services said.
Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Tuesday that it had yet to resume production on two of its platforms after a gas leak forced it to shut down operations earlier this week, cutting Norway's total oil output by 200,000 barrels per day.
The leak at the Snorre A platform forced the evacuation of 180 crew, and shut down that field and the adjacent Vigdis fields, with a combined daily capacity of 205,000 barrels of oil.
The shutdown resulted in a roughly 6.4 percent reduction in the 3.2 million barrel per day production capacity that makes Norway the world's third-largest oil exporter, after Saudi Arabia and Russia.
The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority rejected Statoil ASA's plan to resume full production from its Snorre A field in the North Sea, nearly two months after a gas leak shut it down.
