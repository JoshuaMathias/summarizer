Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Monday that it was trying to seal off a gas leak on a platform in the North Sea where production had been suspended and most employees evacuated owing to the risk of an explosion.
Norway, the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia and which normally has an average daily production of three million barrels, has seen its production reduced by 345,000 barrels per day (bpd) since it shut down three offshore platforms.
No one was injured, but the leak forced the evacuation of 180 crew from Snorre A platform.
