Lynndie England on Monday pled guilty to charges of abusing Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison but told a court martial she did not believe she was doing wrong when photographed holding a leash on a naked inmate.
Colonel James Pohl halted court-martial proceedings Wednesday after Charles Graner, the alleged ringleader in the abuse scandal, testified that he had ordered Private Lynndie England to hold the leash.
He said that testimony directly contradicted England's guilty plea of Monday, in which she accepted some responsibility for how Iraqi detainees were abused and sexually humiliated in late 2003.
