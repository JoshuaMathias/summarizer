Humane Society International was denied permission by Australia's Federal Court to sue Japanese whaling company Kyodo Senpaku for allegedly killing around 400 minke whales in Antarctic waters the Australian government has declared a whale sanctuary.
Recovery of already depleted stocks could be endangered by the Japanese whalers, the release said.
But after lobbying tiny South Pacific island nations this week, Environment Minister Ian Campbell said the Solomon Islands had vowed to abstain from voting on an expected Japanese motion to end the commercial whaling ban.
Australia condemned Japan's plan to more than double the number of whales it kills in the name of scientific research, pushing for a vote on the issue Wednesday at the annual meeting of the commision that regulates global whaling.
The International Whaling Commission (IWC) on Wednesday defeated a Japanese proposal to expand its scientific whaling program by nearly doubling its annual catch of mink whales, which critics say is a commercial hunt in the guise of science.
