Fighting lasted all day Thursday after the heavily-armed clansmen, who want more autonomy and increased benefits from the area's natural resources, ambushed a convoy of paramilitary Frontier Corps soldiers, officials said.
Separately, a bomb exploded in the toilet of a train elsewhere in restive Baluchistan province on Friday, killing one person and wounding five others, two critically, police said.
The province has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but the violence surged after the January rape of a 32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui in Baluchistan.
Tensions in the region escalated Thursday when tribesmen ambushed a convoy of troops and fired rockets at a military base on the outskirts of Dera Bugti, 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Baluchistan province's capital, Quetta.
Thousands of government workers and their families have evacuated a remote town in southwestern Pakistan, a senior official said, amid fears of renewed fighting between renegade tribesmen and security forces after clashes left at least 30 people dead.
