The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that Floyd was expected to intensify today, becoming a Category 3 hurricane, and it could become a Category 4 with sustained winds of at least 131 mph by Tuesday afternoon, when it's expected to reach the northern Bahamas.
From as far south as Miami to as far north as Cape Canaveral, hundreds of thousands of people evacuated the densely populated Florida coast as the storm, with winds of more than 155 mph, crept westward across the Atlantic and forecasters' radar screens.
All day Monday, state meteorologists offered hope that Hurricane Floyd would be nudged from its westerly course by a trough of low pressure air moving to the east and southeast, and, instead of making landfall in South Florida, travel up the coast, its dangerous eye offshore.
In Nassau, the capital, authorities lost telephone links throughout the vulnerable, low-lying archipelago -- including Eleuthera, San Salvador and Cat Island -- where winds reached 110 mph and damage was feared to be extensive.
Hurricane-force wind of at least 75 mph extended 125 miles from Floyd's center.
