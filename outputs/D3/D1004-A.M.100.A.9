The Papua New Guinea (PNG) Defense Force, the police and health services are on standby to help the victims of a tsunami that wiped out several villages, killing scores of people, on PNG's remote north-west coast Friday night.
Tsunami researchers at the National Tidal Facility (NTF) in Adelaide said Monday the northwest coastline had been identified as the most vulnerable area in Australia because of its proximity to the undersea earthquake-prone Java Trench, according to reports by the Australian Associated Press.
The official death toll from Friday's disaster was at least 700, mostly children and the elderly.
