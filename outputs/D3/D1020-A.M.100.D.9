At a daylong public meeting on Wednesday, officials said they had more questions than answers about a spike in outbreaks of listeriosis like the one traced to hot dogs and cold cuts at Michigan's Bil Mar Foods plant in December that has killed 16 people and sickened more than 70 in 14 states.
A New Jersey company known for its high quality foods is voluntarily recalling 26 of it prepared products, including foie gras pates, mousses and terrines, and has forced the closing of the Huntington, N.Y., plant that produced them because of possible contamination with the sometimes deady bacterium, listeria monocytogenes.
