The products, which were distributed nationwide and to foreign countries including Russia and South Korea by Thorn Apple Valley's Forrest City plant, may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced.
At a daylong public meeting on Wednesday, officials said they had more questions than answers about a spike in outbreaks of listeriosis like the one traced to hot dogs and cold cuts at Michigan's Bil Mar Foods plant in December that has killed 16 people and sickened more than 70 in 14 states.
An E. coli outbreak that sickened at least 6 people visiting a Maine ski resort has been traced to contaminated ground beef produced at a Minnesota meat processing plant, authorities said Monday.
The plant on Dec. 22 recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and lunch meats sold under a variety of names -- the largest meat recall ever -- because of suspected contamination with a rare strain of the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes.
