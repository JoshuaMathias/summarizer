A Maryland environmentalist alarmed by the decline of the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster population is trying to get it on the federal Endangered Species list -- sparking an uproar of opposition in the oyster industry from Maine to Louisiana.
If it were revived to 25 times its current size -- about the level found between 1920 and 1970 -- excessive nitrogen levels in the bay would fall by 11 million pounds each year, and underwater grasses would increase by more than 20 percent, said the researchers, who are studying the oyster restoration methods for the state Department of Natural Resources.
