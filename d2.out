D1001A-A :  Columbine Massacre 
COLO-SCHOOL-SHOOTING (Littleton, Colo.) _ The governor of Colorado tours Columbine High School and says investigators are all but certain that the two gunmen had help from others; the police say security cameras may provide crucial evidence of a conspiracy.
There are myriad mini-communities created by the bloodshed: Denver-area students, their rivalries suddenly rendered irrelevant; emergency personnel, united in their harrowing experiences; towns like Jonesboro and Paducah and Springfield and Edinboro, who understand Columbine's anguish but never asked to be members of this kind of community.

D1002A-A :  Diallo Trial 
With the indictments barely unsealed against four police officers in the Amadou Diallo shooting, a battle is already taking shape over physical evidence in the case, as lawyers and experts seek to buttress their own versions of what happened based on entrance wounds, bullet trajectories and other forensic details.
The parents of Amadou Diallo plan to meet with the Bronx district attorney on Wednesday to receive a preview of the criminal charges that the grand jury voted to bring against the four New York City police officers who killed their son seven weeks ago.

D1006A-A :  Vioxx 
Though the new study was more comprehensive than past research because it looked at patients over the course of three years, research since November 2000 has suggested that those who take Vioxx face a heart attack risk four to five times greater than those who take older, equally effective arthritis treatments such as ibuprofen and naproxen.
Now research lab director Peter Kim and general counsel Kenneth Frazier were flying to Boston to tell one of the men most responsible for Vioxx's success that Merck would be pulling the drug in two days.

D1010B-A :  Mad Cow Disease 
Beef sold in Bulgaria since June 2004 has not been certified free of mad cow disease because the test used is not officially recognised by the European Union, mad-cow expert Roumen Valchovski said Friday.
In an interview in the Bulgarian newspaper Troud, the director of Bulgaria's laboratory for detecting mad cow, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), Raiko Pechev said the Dutch test was "more precise, more rapid" than tests already approved by the EU and "is in its last stage of EU pre-certification trials".

D1011C-A :  Eating Disorders 
A very small study, led by researchers at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and at Massachusetts General Hospital and published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that leptin restored menstrual periods in a few female athletes who hadn't had periods for an average of 5 1/2 years.

KUWAIT CITY, January 23 (Xinhua) -- More than half of the 710,000 Kuwaiti citizens are suffering from obesity and anemia because of poor eating habits and other causes, according to studies by a leading local nutritionist.
A recent survey found that 12.6 percent of 4,895 adults and 11.35 percent of 9,093 children who live in urban Shanghai are obese, and these figures are close to the average weight proportion seen in developed countries, it was reported in today's "Wen Hui Bao Daily."

D1015C-A :  Rain Forest Destruction 
Yunnan plans to achieve widespread improvement in its environment by the first decade of the next century, with forest coverage rate hitting 30 percent, and the area of natural reserve zones accounting for eight percent of the province's total land.
This allows the tropical rain forest to harbor many rare and valuable flora and fauna that are on the verge of extinction elsewhere, Han says, but because it's between a torrid zone and a subtropical zone, it is more fragile than those at the equator.

D1016C-A :  Soeharto Investigation 
Soeharto's fortune, part of which has been sold to his crony and noted businessman Prayogo Pangestu, reportedly comprised stocks, land, a plywood factory, a bank, a pineapple cannery and a TV relay station, worth 122.4 billion rupiah (15.3 million U.S. dollars) in all.
After an uncertain response to wide calls for a thorough investigation into the wealth of Soeharto, his family and friends, the dominant Golkar (Functional Group) faction has finally changed its position, saying that it strongly supports the wealth probe.

According to an advance text of his Saturday radio address, the president will also ask Congress to give the Food and Drug Administration ``greater authority to halt imports of fruits, vegetables and other food products that are produced under safety conditions that do not match our own strict standards,'' and to give the Department of Agriculture ``new authority to impose tough fines on businesses who violate those standards and to issue mandatory recall of unsafe meat and poultry.''
I'm sure we didn't for a lot of people.''

D1021D-A :  Debra La Fave 
"To try to use (media interest) to make it more difficult for the victims' family to go through this process made sense from a tactical standpoint," said Hillsborough prosecutor Mike Sinacore, noting that Lafave attended many hearings in the case, ensuring cameras would capture her every move.
"We've gotten over one hurdle with this matter in the criminal justice system, but now the ramification of being a sexual offender will be with Debbie for 10 years or longer," said her attorney, John Fitzgibbons.

D1025E-A :  Grizzly Bears 
If the administration goes ahead with dropping the bears' current ``threatened'' status -- a move that would not take place until the end of 2006 at the earliest -- officials in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming would be free to allow limited hunting of grizzlies and would not have to maintain the same level of protection on the grizzlies' habitat.
Affluent outsiders have overrun Flathead County in the past 15 years, fueling 37 percent population growth and creating a service-based economy that needs grizzlies as toothsome symbols of an eco-friendly western lifestyle.

D1026E-A :  Head Injuries 
The New South Wales state government brought charges against the ranch owner, who employed 23-year-old Daniel Croker, convicting and fining the company 95,000 Australian dollars (US$72,000; euro56,000) last month for breaches of safety, including failure to provide the horseman with an equestrian helmet.

D1029F-A :  Baluchistan Uprising 
Armed tribesmen have surrounded some 300 paramilitary troops and government officials at a base in a southwestern Pakistani town where fears of fresh fighting between renegade tribesmen and troops have forced thousands of residents to flee for safety, an official said Sunday.

D1035G-A :  Agent Orange 
A review of what has been done to determine how Agent Orange and other herbicides affected Vietnam veterans confirms earlier studies linking them with several diseases but leaves unanswered painful medical questions of the war that ended 24 years ago.
Despite continuing investigation into possible links to birth defects, diabetes and a list of other illnesses, no scientific studies over the last two years has provided enough information to draw significant new conclusions about whether herbicides are linked to any condition, study director Dr. David Tollerud said.

D1040G-A :  Robert Blake Murder Trial 
Robert Blake deserves to be convicted of killing his wife, and the actor's celebrity shouldn't gain him any special treatment, a prosecutor told jurors Wednesday in closing arguments.
Over the past two months, observers in Van Nuys Superior Court in Los Angeles have been fed a steady diet of comic-book-style characters, a tattooed mobster-turned preacher, two strung-out stunt doubles who say they had been solicited by Blake to double as hit men; accounts of space aliens, experiments with crack-smoking monkeys and salacious details of a love child.

Lynndie R. England, the young Army reservist whose grinning, thumbs-up image came to symbolize the worst of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, told a military judge Monday that she knew the detainee abuses were wrong but went along because of peer pressure.
