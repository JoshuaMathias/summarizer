LOS ANGELES _ School has been out at Cal State Northridge since
the week before Christmas, but since you can learn something every
day, Mississippi State's women's basketball team gave a lesson.

Northridge has talked about taking its game to the next level.
The 21st-ranked Bulldogs _ the first nationally ranked team to play
here in Northridge's Division I era _ gave a glimpse of that level
in a 98-64 nonconference victory before a crowd of 165 Friday
night.

It ended CSUN's 16-game home win streak.

Whether the Matadors learned from the Bulldogs (10-0) remains to
be seen. The Big Sky Conference season begins Thursday at Northern
Arizona, but the Matadors don't believe they'll face anyone of this
caliber.

``Our conference isn't that strong,'' Edneisha Curry admitted,
``so we have to play hard and play with the type of desire and
heart night in and night out, so we can play with Mississippi State
and all the other ranked teams.''
