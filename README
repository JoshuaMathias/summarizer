D2 "README" file

note: the D2 requirements specify a "README" file, so here it is.
I didn't want to assume "README.md" and miss the requirements.

Overview
========
Instructions for running the D2 summarizer code on pandas.
The two examples below show how to run via condor and the command line.
See "Post-run" for how to run rouge scores.





This is followed by an overview of the call sequence and a summary
of the configuration details in case you want to run the system on
a different topic set.


Prereqs:
========
To run the system your current working directory needs to be in the project root.
Typically we extract into a summarizer folder.


Post-run:
========

To get D2 rouge scores you need to run
+---------------------
|    $ bin/rouge.sh
+---------------------

This will write the rouge scores to .../results/D2_rouge_scores.out


Run the D2 Summarizer:
======================

To run via condor:
+---------------------
|  $ cd summarizer
|  $ condor_submit D2.cmd
|  $ bin/condor_status.sh
+---------------------
The last step is optional (but convenient), hit ^C to exit the status loop.


Recommended way to run via command line (on patas or dryas):
+---------------------
|  $ cd summarizer
|  $ bin/summarizer_patas > run.dat
+---------------------
Despite the name of the script it will work on patas or dryas.
Status messages are written to STDERR.
The actually summaries are written to STDOUT as well as the
individual docset outputs/D2 files.  "run.dat" is just a
convenience to gather operational data.

Additional Information
======================

    Call Sequence
-------------------------------------
  (i)   bin/summarizer_patas
 (ii)   bin/summarizer bin/config_patas.yaml
(iii)   src/summarizer.py -c bin/config_patas.yaml

(i) is just a stub shell that has a suitable D2 config file hardwired into it.
(ii) passes the config file from (i) into (iii).
     NOTE: (ii) will also clear the outputs/D2 directory.


Configuration Information

We're using *.yml (yaml) files to say which paths to use.
If you want to point at a different topic index you can change
the value on the aquaint_topic_index property.
So far we have only tested with "devtest/GuidedSumm10_test_topics.xml"
so we don't know if other topic.xml files will cause issues.



sample config file (used for D2)
