D1001A-A : Columbine Massacre
Vice President Al Gore on Sunday bid farewell to Columbine High School's dead, issuing a ringing challenge to parents and schools before a crowd of 70,000.
Investigators, spending the day at the memorial service, were to resume their work this morning, conducting more interviews and eyeing the possibility of additional suspects in Tuesday's massacre.
Monday, Columbine and Chatfield senior high schools came together yet again, neither as rivals nor as mourners, but as partners in helping Columbine students to reclaim their lives as normal teenagers for whom school is a place to learn, not to flee.
The witness list was still in its infancy late Monday, but several people close to the committee said it could include individuals involved in the Columbine tragedy, survivors of other school shootings, entertainment industry executives and interest groups on both sides of the gun control debate.
The yearbook shows the senior pictures of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who killed 12 classmates and a teacher inside the school April 20 before taking their own lives.

D1002A-A : Diallo Trial
Some of the police officers who shot and killed Amadou Diallo have told associates that their attention was initially drawn to Diallo when they saw him standing on the stoop of a Bronx apartment building and thought they saw him peering into the window of a first-floor apartment, according to people with knowledge of the case.
Judge John P. Collins set bail at $100,000 for each officer, even though District Attorney Robert Johnson had asked that they be held without bail.
Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy -- who were searching for a rape suspect and fired apparently believing Diallo had a gun -- showed little emotion when the charges were read.
The four police officers accused of murder in the shooting death of Amadou Diallo plan to testify in their own defense at their trial next month and are leaning toward choosing a trial by a judge instead of a jury, according to their lawyers.
The decision by a state appellate court to move the criminal trial of four New York City police officers charged with the killing of Amadou Diallo to Albany County seems unjustified.

D1003A-A : Giant Panda
On Dec. 14 last year, Feng Shiliang, a farmer from Youfangzui Village, told the Fengxian County Wildlife Management Station that he had spotted an animal that looked very much like a giant panda and had seen giant panda dung while collecting bamboo leaves on a local mountain.
China has applied to the United Nations to make giant pandas' natural habitat in southwestern Sichuan province a world heritage area to help protect the endangered species, state press reported Tuesday.
Wu said the regional telcom network covers the administrative office building of Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, a giant panda museum, and China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Pandas (CCRCGP), the open-air habitat for the endangered species.
The National Zoo's female panda, Mei Xiang, gave birth early Saturday morning to a squealing cub the size of a stick of butter, and keepers say she is caring for it tenderly.

D1004A-A : Papua Tsunami
Disaster authorities said the area, about 600 kilometers (370 miles) northwest of the capital of Port Moresby, is spotted with villages consisting of homes made of jungle materials and built on beaches.
Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on Papua New Guinea's northwest coast, said the tsunami that hit the coast west of the village on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had almost completely destroyed another.
The 23-foot (7-meter) wall of water, stirred up by a magnitude-7 undersea earthquake, also destroyed at least three other villages Friday night when it crashed into the northwest coast of Papua New Guinea, a nation on the island of New Guinea, north of Australia, where some people live a near-Stone Age existence amid jungles and swamps.
As Australian aid workers opened a field hospital on high ground and relief supplies began trickling in, Papua New Guinea's prime minister, Bill Skate, toured the worst-hit villages and the Sissano lagoon, choked with dead fish and hundreds of rotting human bodies.

D1005A-A : Parkinson Disease
Like many degenerative brain diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, proteins targeted in the disease process begin misfolding and clumping in or around brain cells, which are called neurons.
Californians voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to become the first US state to fund controversial embryonic stem cell research that was effectively banned by President George W. Bush, US media reported.
A new medical study helps explain the puzzling effect of the hormone dopamine on patients suffering from the degenerative nerve disorder Parkinson's disease, said a report out Thursday.
A small group of people with Parkinson's disease had been pleading for months with the biotechnology company Amgen: Let them resume taking an experimental drug that the patients said had helped them but which the company said was ineffective and possibly dangerous.
Amgen's decision reverberated beyond the 48 patients in the trials because the drug, called glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, or GDNF, had the potential to stall or even reverse the progression of the disease rather than just reduce the symptoms, as the currently available Parkinson's drugs do.

D1006A-A : Vioxx
Studies done five years ago when Celebrex and Merck & Co.'s Vioxx were approved suggest that the same mechanism that inhibits inflammation and makes the drugs easier on the stomach than traditional painkillers also blocks a substance that prevents heart problems, according to Dr. Garret FitzGerald, a University of Pennsylvania cardiologist.
Dr. David J. Graham, associate director for science in the FDA Drug Center's Office of Drug Safety, told Senate investigators he faced stiff resistance within the regulatory agency to his findings.
Pfizer Inc. warned doctors on Friday that one of its bestselling painkillers, Bextra, might increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke in coronary artery bypass surgery patients.
Merck and federal officials should have withdrawn the painkiller Vioxx from the market as early as 2000 because studies of the drug had clearly shown that it doubled the risk of heart attacks among users, according to a study released Thursday by The Lancet, a British medical journal.
Vioxx belonged to a class of drugs called Cox-2 inhibitors.

D1007B-A : Bird Flu
HONG KONG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) set up an inter-department working group today to coordinate efforts towards the prevention and control of the spread of a mysterious "bird flu" that has killed two people.
The Public Health Department of Macao has called on residents to avoid contacting birds, and take proper protective measures if they have to.
HONG KONG, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Department of Health (DH) announced Wednesday three more new Influenza A H5N1 cases, which brings the total number of cases to nine confirmed and six suspected.
HONG KONG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Test results related to the first bird flu case detected in a human suggested that the main mode of influenza A H5N1 virus transmission was bird-to-human, it was known here Saturday.
The move is being taken following the discovery of the H5N1 virus in samples taken from a local chicken farm and the sudden death of chickens at a wholesale poultry market.

D1008B-A : Chesapeake Bay
Last weekend, three generations of the Beck family -- Bill, son Craig and father John, 76 -- boarded their boat with renewed optimism as nearly 4,000 bushels of disease-free oysters were made available for harvesting for the first time since they were hatched and planted three years ago.
Gerald Baliles, who led a committee that studied the bay cleanup last year.
A Maryland environmentalist alarmed by the decline of the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster population is trying to get it on the federal Endangered Species list -- sparking an uproar of opposition in the oyster industry from Maine to Louisiana.
Millions of young oysters are being planted on oyster bars in the river as part of the project, grasses that provide oxygen and habitat for marine life are being restored, and monitoring for water quality will be stepped up, officials said.
A Government Accountability Office review found that the Chesapeake Bay Program Office -- an arm of the Environmental Protection Agency -- has no coordinated, comprehensive plan for cutting pollution in the bay, even after nearly $6 billion in state and federal money has been devoted to the effort in the past decade.

D1009B-A : Jon Benet Ramsey
The Ramseys and their two children were the only people known to be living at the Ramsey house on the night of the murder, 18 months ago.
Three former friends of the parents of JonBenet Ramsey have asked for a special prosecutor to take over the stalled 20-month-old investigation into the slaying of JonBenet, the 6-year-old Colorado beauty princess.
Hunter ``has provided evidence to Ramsey defense attorneys at their request'' but denied requests by other witnesses for transcripts of their own statements to the police, wrote Fleet and Priscilla White, a couple who had the Ramsey family to their home for dinner on Dec. 25, 1996, a few hours before JonBenet was found dead.
The district attorney in Colorado overseeing the JonBenet Ramsey homicide case on Friday appointed two new special prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury.
Linda Arndt, who was the only detective in John and Patsy Ramsey's home when their daughter's body was found, has resigned from the Boulder Police Department after 11 years.
Burke Ramsey appeared before the panel last week, according to today's Denver Rocky Mountain News, which cited a family friend, and KUSA-TV.

D1010B-A : Mad Cow Disease
The European Union head office said Friday it was allocating euro98.1 million (US$122 million) on testing cattle across the 25-nation bloc to prevent the spread of mad cow disease next year.
Since 1996, public health authorities have warned that people may catch vCJD from eating meat infected with mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or from infected blood transfusions.
A French goat slaughtered in 2002 has tested positive for "mad cow" disease, the French agriculture ministry said Friday, in what is the first known case in the world of the fatal illness in an animal other than a bovine.
The Japanese government announced Friday mad cow disease was behind the death of man in December, the first confirmed human death case in Japan as a result of the deadly infection.
Brain tissue samples from a suspected US beef cow began its trip to England on Thursday for final tests to confirm if it is the second case of mad cow disease in the United States.

D1011C-A : Eating Disorders
A very small study, led by researchers at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and at Massachusetts General Hospital and published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that leptin restored menstrual periods in a few female athletes who hadn't had periods for an average of 5 1/2 years.
Italy's TV channels broadcast twice as many commercials featuring food as their US counterparts, threatening children who watch them with serious eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia, according to a study published here Tuesday.
For panic disorder, phobias and other severe anxiety disorders, psychiatrists often rely on a specific type of treatment called exposure therapy, in which patients gradually learn to feel comfortable in situations they dread.
About 1 percent of American women suffer from anorexia, a disease than can also affect men.
Dr. James Hudson, director of the biological psychiatry laboratory at McLean and an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, recruited 300 people, half with a history of binge eating, and then set out to interview their parents, children and siblings.

D1012C-A : Helios Crash
Greek Defense Ministry and fire department said that the plane crashed to a mountain at about 12:20 p.m. (0920 GMT) near the coastal town of Grammatikos, about 40 kilometers north of Athens, just a few minutes before its scheduled landing time on a flight from Larnaca International Airport of Cyprus to Prague via Athens.
ATHENS, Greece -- A Cypriot passenger plane with 121 people on board crashed Sunday just north of the Greek capital, after being shadowed for 43 helpless minutes by fighter jets reporting that the co-pilot was slumped over the controls and that there was no sign of the pilot.
But Fillipos Koutsaftis could not rule out that the six people were unconscious when the Helios Airways Boeing 737-300, with six crew and 115 passengers, plunged 10,400 meters (34,000 feet) Sunday into a mountainous area near the village of Grammatiko, 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Athens.
One month after Greece's worst air accident, a conclusive explanation of what caused a Cypriot Helios Airways airliner to crash killing all 121 people on board still eludes investigators, but recent reports suggest pilots may have failed to respond to a cabin pressure warning.

D1013C-A : Identity Theft
Calling privacy in the age of electronic commerce ``a basic American value'' that ``must be protected,'' Vice President Al Gore made public a list of a dozen or so new initiatives that seek to tighten the security of financial and medical records and to protect the privacy of children who use the Internet.
The police said Santner had masterminded the biggest identity theft scam ever seen in San Francisco, with a ring of thieves who took names and Social Security numbers of other people and then created fraudulent paper trails.
The report had been forwarded by one of the stores to which he had applied _ Robinsons-May _ through its parent company, the May Department Stores, to the Stores Protective Association, a nonprofit group in Simi Valley, Calif., that provides background screening, work histories and loss-prevention programs to about 100 retail chains, manufacturers and other businesses.
Identity theft occurs when someone hijacks a consumer's personal identifying information such as a name, address, credit card or Social Security number and uses the information to open new charge accounts or purchase merchandise.

D1014C-A : Obesity
KUWAIT CITY, November 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 percent of Kuwaiti women are obese and suffer from other chronic ailments such as vein-hardening, diabetes and hypertension, local press reported today, citing a Kuwaiti psychologist.
The most recent findings from the 19-year-old San Antonio Heart Study, which follows 5,100 adults around the South Texas city, show the rate of new Type 2 diabetes cases rose by 9 percent per year on average over the decade ending in 1996.
UNDATED - Health specialists are calling it a ``fat epidemic,'' and no wonder with the latest numbers showing that more than half of Americans are overweight and one out of three adults is obese.
The fat and fatter trend has initiated more research into obesity than ever, especially in light of another group of findings linking extra weight to myriad serious health problems, including heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes and even some forms of cancer.
We live in a society in which people drive instead of walk, fast food is available 24 hours a day, children are bombarded with advertisements for junk food, and one-quarter of all the vegetables we eat are french fries.

D1015C-A : Rain Forest Destruction
China's largest tropical rain forest, in the Xishuangbanna nature reserve in Yunnan Province, will get further protection when the reserve is enlarged from 247,000 ha to 533,000 ha, according to Zhuang Yan, head of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture.
A team of U.S. forest experts arrived in southern Mexico last month to help Mexican firefighters gain control of the blazes, which have endangered rare plant and animal species and spewed a thick haze of smoke across Mexico and the United States.
The world's forests have been under siege since the turn of the century, but this year has been calamitous.
In Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Central America, Africa, and Indonesia, fires have destroyed nearly 40 million forested acres, an area as large as New York state.
Tensions are rising in Venezuela's Amazon rain forests, where Indians and environmentalists are clashing with mining companies and government officials who want to exploit some of the richest gold deposits in Latin America and build towns and tourist hotels in the wilderness.

D1016C-A : Soeharto Investigation
JAKARTA (JP): The government has launched an investigation into corruption under former president Soeharto but has no plans to specifically target the former Indonesian leader, Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro told a packed news conference here yesterday.
However, a foreign media once estimated Soeharto's and his family's fortune is worth 40 billion U.S. dollars.
Article four of the decree states that efforts to eradicate corruption, collusion and nepotism must be made indiscriminately upon any state officials, former state officials, their families and cronies as well as private businessmen, business tycoons and former president Soeharto.
Habibie Monday instructed Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib to study intensively all the data provided by the U.S. Time magazine on the alleged wealth of former President Soeharto and his family abroad.
Indonesian former president Soeharto will not come to the Attorney General Office on Monday to undergo an investigation on corruption cases due to health reasons, chief of Soeharto's legal defender team Juan Felix Tampubolon said here on Friday.

D1017D-A : Hurricane Floyd
Water managers and county emergency workers were on alert, while some anxious people in Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast stocked up on storm supplies.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that Floyd was expected to intensify today, becoming a Category 3 hurricane, and it could become a Category 4 with sustained winds of at least 131 mph by Tuesday afternoon, when it's expected to reach the northern Bahamas.
Hurricane Floyd strengthened to a very dangerous Category 4 storm today with 155 mph wind, surprising forecasters and charging toward the Bahamas on a path that also threatened the Florida coast.
Bearing down on Florida, Georgia and South Carolina -- where nearly 2 million people were urged to leave its path -- Floyd flung trees and debris into buildings in the Bahamas and chased frightened tourists from exposed hotel rooms to more enclosed space.
In Nassau, the capital, authorities lost telephone links throughout the vulnerable, low-lying archipelago -- including Eleuthera, San Salvador and Cat Island -- where winds reached 110 mph and damage was feared to be extensive.

D1018D-A : Joran Van Der Sloot
NOORD, Aruba (AP) _ Police on Thursday searched for clues into the disappearance of an Alabama teen a day after conducting a late-night helicopter flyover of the Dutch Caribbean island and seizing items from the home of a Dutch justice official whose son was with her the day she went missing.
Also Saturday, the lawyer for one of two Surinamese brothers being held in connection with Holloway's disappearance confirmed that Satish Kalpoe admitted lying to police when he told them that he and his brother and their Dutch friend dropped Holloway off alone at her hotel, the Holiday Inn, the night she disappeared.
The father of a Dutch teenager arrested in the disappearance of a young U.S. woman told his son and his two friends that "when there is no body you don't have a case," Aruba's attorney general said Wednesday.
Paul van der Sloot, a judge in training in Aruba, gave his 17-year-old son Joran van der Sloot and two Surinamese brothers legal advice the day after 18-year-old Natalee Holloway disappeared, District Attorney Caren Janssen told MSNBC in an interview.

D1019D-A : Malaysia Resort Abduction
KUALA LUMPUR, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 20 people were taken hostage by six heavily armed men Sunday night from Sipadan island off Sabah, East Malaysia, but their motives behind the abduction are yet to be confirmed, Malaysian Police said Monday.
It was however confirmed that among the hostages, there are 11 foreigners -- three Germans, two South Africans, two French nationals, two Finns, one Lebanese and one Filipino while the rest nine are Malaysians comprising four workers of the Wildlife Department, three workers of the Sipadan resort center, a policeman and a staff of Syarikat Borneo Divers.
The government has refused several rebel demands, including the release of three Arab terrorists held in jails in the United States.
The Philippine Muslim extremist group Abu Sayyaf has threatened to behead some of the 21 hostages they abducted last Sunday in Malaysia because they do not want to talk with a government negotiator.
According to reports from Zamboanga City, the southern Philippines,an Abu Sayyaf spokesman told Radio Mindanao Network Friday night that Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao, is unacceptable as negotiator.

D1020D-A : Recall Food United States
The products, which were distributed nationwide and to foreign countries including Russia and South Korea by Thorn Apple Valley's Forrest City plant, may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced.
At a daylong public meeting on Wednesday, officials said they had more questions than answers about a spike in outbreaks of listeriosis like the one traced to hot dogs and cold cuts at Michigan's Bil Mar Foods plant in December that has killed 16 people and sickened more than 70 in 14 states.
An E. coli outbreak that sickened at least 6 people visiting a Maine ski resort has been traced to contaminated ground beef produced at a Minnesota meat processing plant, authorities said Monday.
The plant on Dec. 22 recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and lunch meats sold under a variety of names -- the largest meat recall ever -- because of suspected contamination with a rare strain of the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes.

D1021D-A : Debra La Fave
The mother of a 14-year-old middle school student says she believes the case of a former teacher accused of having sex with her son should not go to trial.
The victim, who had sex with Tampa teacher Debra Lafave, has suffered extreme anxiety from the intense media coverage surrounding the case, a psychiatrist who examined the boy told Circuit Court Judge Hale Stancil at the hearing Wednesday.
Lafave was sentenced in Hillsborough County, where Tampa is located, to three years of house arrest and seven years probation after pleading guilty Nov. 22 to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery for having sex with the boy in a classroom and her home.
A Florida teacher who admitted having sex several times with her 14-year-old student was freed Tuesday after prosecutors dropped sexual abuse charges to avoid calling the boy to the witness stand.
First came a Marion County judge's rejection Tuesday morning of a plea deal, a rare and controversial move that meant Lafave could face a sensational trial and as many as four decades in prison.

D1022D-A : Whale Conservation Japan
Humane Society International was denied permission by Australia's Federal Court to sue Japanese whaling company Kyodo Senpaku for allegedly killing around 400 minke whales in Antarctic waters the Australian government has declared a whale sanctuary.
But after lobbying tiny South Pacific island nations this week, Environment Minister Ian Campbell said the Solomon Islands had vowed to abstain from voting on an expected Japanese motion to end the commercial whaling ban.
A majority would give pro-whaling countries broad authority to set the commission's agenda.
Australia condemned Japan's plan to more than double the number of whales it kills in the name of scientific research, pushing for a vote on the issue Wednesday at the annual meeting of the commision that regulates global whaling.
The International Whaling Commission (IWC) on Wednesday defeated a Japanese proposal to expand its scientific whaling program by nearly doubling its annual catch of mink whales, which critics say is a commercial hunt in the guise of science.

D1023E-A : Austrian Avalanches
Driving snow and deadly winds prevented emergency helicopters from flying into the ski village of Galtuer, near the Swiss border, where local rescue workers spent the night digging through walls of snow and rubble for survivors.
At least eight people have been confirmed killed and 30 others injured as two avalanches roared through a ski resort in Austria's western state of Triol on Tuesday evening, the Austrian news media reported.
LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Another killer avalanche brought new heartache to Western Austria today, striking just miles from where rescuers were digging for victims of Europe's worst snowslide this winter.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress should just let the independent counsel law expire since almost any effort to revise it so soon after President Clinton's impeachment acquittal ``is likely to be a mistake,'' former White House chief of staff Howard Baker told a Senate committee today.
The surprise announcement came a day after Kosovo peace talks concluded without any breakthrough on a deal to end a year of fighting in the southern Serbian province.

D1024E-A : Bomb Khartoum
KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir on Friday recalled Sudan's diplomats from Washington to protest the U.S. missile strike on a factory in the Sudanese capital a day earlier.
He said Sudan could ``prove that the factory is specifically for pharmaceutical production'' and not the chemical weapons facility described by U.S. officials.
Clinton said the missiles hit terrorist camps in Afghanistan run by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire blamed by Washington for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and a factory linked to bin Laden in Sudan.
KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ America's missile barrage on a pharmaceutical plant in the outskirts of Sudan's capital was called a strike against outlaw states that support terrorism.
After a cabinet meeting chaired by Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, Minister of Culture and Information Ghazi Saleh el-Din said the government has also decided to file compliants with the United Nations, the Arab League and other international organizations over the U.S. attack.

D1025E-A : Grizzly Bears
Despite the record number of dead bears last year, the Fish and Wildlife Service believes the grizzlies, whose population has more than doubled in the three decades it has been on the list, no longer need the special protection afforded by the law.
If the administration goes ahead with dropping the bears' current ``threatened'' status -- a move that would not take place until the end of 2006 at the earliest -- officials in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming would be free to allow limited hunting of grizzlies and would not have to maintain the same level of protection on the grizzlies' habitat.
Federal officials have begun the process of removing grizzly bears around Yellowstone National Park from the Endangered Species List, ending 30 years of protection and shifting responsibility for their management to state officials who may allow hunting.
On Tuesday, an improbable assemblage of officials from the provincial government, coastal Native Canadian nations, logging companies, and environmental groups will announce an agreement that they say will accomplish that mission in the home of the spirit bear, an area that is also the world's largest remaining intact temperate coastal rain forest.

D1026E-A : Head Injuries
At the same time, ASEAN countries will promote the gradual harmonization and amendment of the key road safety regulations and to promote awareness and steady enforcement of traffic rules and regulations among the citizens, such as those pertaining to speed limits, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and the wearing of safety helmets and safety seat belts.
Most soccer players on the Santa Clara University women's team will enter the NCAA quarterfinals on Saturday wearing protective equipment -- headgear -- that is as controversial as it is lightweight.
The number of motorcyclists dying on Arizona roads has dramatically increased in the past five years in part because new riders and veterans who haven't ridden for years are hitting the streets without proper training, experts say.
The peak year for Arizona motorcycle fatalities was 1979 with 134 fatalities, three years after the state's short-lived helmet law was repealed.
More than 3,900 people died on motorcycles in the United States in 2004, up 7.3 percent from the year before, according to preliminary highway safety numbers released Thursday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

D1027E-A : Shepard Beating Death Trial
The day before one of the men accused of killing her son was going on trial in Wyoming, the mother of gay college student Matthew Shepard lobbied tearfully for hate-crime laws that could deter future acts of violence.
Fourteen people were dismissed Thursday as jury selection continued in the trial of a man accused of beating gay college student Matthew Shepard to death.
President Clinton plans to endorse a bill Tuesday that would expand federal hate crime laws to include offenses based on sexual orientation, White House officials said.
Skaggs is the defense attorney and Rerucha the prosecutor in the trial of Russell Henderson, who is charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in the fatal beating Oct. 6 of gay university student Matthew Shepard.
Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar last October, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to a fence in the cold.

D1028E-A : Unabomber Trial
In a statement, Washington, D.C. attorney Anthony Bisceglie said he had informed Kaczynski's brother David and his mother Wanda of Reno's decision to authorize prosecutors to seek the death penalty in the case.
Kaczynski, the 55-year-old former university math instructor is suspected of being the UNABOMber, the mailbomb terrorist who killed three people and injured 23 others in 17 years before his arrest last year.
In an order filed late Friday afternoon and distributed by a court document service today, U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. in Sacramento, California, said defense lawyers Quin Denvir and Judy Clarke had failed to prove the necessity of expanding the jury pool beyond the list of registered voters, media reports said.
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The trial of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski in Sacramento, California, is on hold following a surprise meeting with the judge and his lawyers, reportedly to air complaints about his defense, media reports said.
He added that federal and state taxes could gobble up almost half of the reward.

D1029F-A : Baluchistan Uprising
Fierce gun battles between tribal rebels and Pakistani troops in the troubled southwestern province of Baluchistan have left up to 30 people dead and more than 70 injured, an official said Friday.
Fighting lasted all day Thursday after the heavily-armed clansmen, who want more autonomy and increased benefits from the area's natural resources, ambushed a convoy of paramilitary Frontier Corps soldiers, officials said.
The province has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but the violence surged after the January rape of a 32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui in Baluchistan.
The tribesmen have set up road blocks and dug trenches along roads into Dera Bugti, a town of about 84,000 people which lies 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of the Baluchistan provincial capital, Quetta, Baluchistan Gov.
Seventeen minority Hindus were killed when their temple was hit by rockets during fighting between renegade tribesmen and security forces in a restive tribal town in southwestern Pakistan last week, a government official said Monday.

D1030F-A : Ephedra
Yet, because herbal products are classified as dietary supplements, not drugs, and face none of the premarket hurdles drugs must clear, consumers have no assurance of safety or effectiveness.
Alarmed by what they see as the potential for mishaps with patients taking herbal remedies for everything from depression to memory loss, anesthesiologists have begun urging people to stop taking the herbs and supplements before having surgery.
Weight loss, muscle building, and energy boosting products containing ephedrine have not been recalled by the FDA, although the agency issued several warnings after it investigated more than 800 adverse health events including heart attack, stroke, seizure, and more than 30 deaths associated with products containing ephedrine.
The federal Food and Drug Administration says it has received hundreds of reports from physicians, health authorities and others about adverse reactions to ephedrine-based products.
Gyllenhaal said the study, published in the June issue of Sleep Medicine Reviews, found reason for doctors to be concerned about ephedra because of the disorders that it could make worse, including high blood pressure and diabetes, besides possibly unintended effects on sleep.

D1031F-A : Mangrove Forests
The United Nations Thursday set aside $1 million to assess environmental damage caused by this week's devastating tsunami, as reports of destroyed coral reefs and uprooted mangrove forests began trickling in.
While attention is clearly focused on the rising human toll of the tragedy, some dive operators and marine biologists are reporting that from Sri Lanka to Thailand corals are suffocating under layers of mud, heaps of rotten fish, are clogging beachfronts, and rare turtle nesting sites have been washed out to sea.
Coral reefs, mangroves, fish and other marine life had been damaged by the tsunamis which rose out of the Indian Ocean on Sunday, triggered by a massive earthquake near the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
But outside the gates of the theme park is a natural world of flesh-and-blood wildlife.
As the people of Indonesia's Aceh province try to rebuild lives shattered by the tsunami disaster, officials are also assessing the environmental damage to the coast which bore the brunt of the giant waves.

D1032F-A : Offshore Gas Leak
The state-controlled oil company said it hopes full production from Snorre and the satellite field Vigdis will resume by Dec. 31.
The Snorre A offshore oil platform is unlikely to resume production this week after being shut down by a natural gas leak because more time is needed to review plans, the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority said Thursday.
The damage had forced Shell to cut production to 75,000 barrels per day in the field in the Norwegian Sea on Tuesday, but had shut down completely because bad weather prevented repairs, company spokeswoman Kitty Eide said.
Norwegian oil group Statoil on Tuesday requested permission to gradually resume production on two platforms in the North Sea that were shut down last November due to a gas leak, targeting a production of 100,000 barrels per day in the short term.
The shutdown resulted in a roughly 6.4 percent reduction in the 3.2 million barrel per day production capacity that makes Norway the world's third-largest oil exporter, after Saudi Arabia and Russia.

D1033F-A : South Korean Wire Tapping
Ambassador Hong Seok-Hyun called the office of President Roh Moo-Hyun late Monday and offered to resign, presidential spokesman Kim Man-Soo said, indicating Hong's resignation would be accepted.
South Korea's spy agency publicly apologized Friday for illegally wiretapping telephone calls years ago, revealed by the leakage of a taped 1997 conversation of an alleged payment by the Samsung Group to presidential candidates.
Lim Dong-won and Shin Gunn, who headed the National Intelligence Service successively between December 1999 and April 2003, are suspected of overseeing the agency's monitoring of mobile phone conversations of about 1,800 of South Korea's political, corporate and media elite, the Seoul District Prosecutors' Office said.
The wiretapping scandal began in July following revelations of an alleged 1997 conversation between Hong Seok-hyun, then publisher of the mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo newspaper, and Lee Hak-soo, a top executive with Samsung Group, the country's largest industrial conglomerate.

D1034F-A : Threat To Frogs
The findings of more than 500 scientists were included in the first-ever global amphibian assessment, a three-year effort by researchers with IUCN-The World Conservation Union, the Center for Applied Biodiversity Science of Conservation International and NatureServe.
Amphibians' permeable skin and dual existence on land and in water make them "canaries in the coal mine," early indicators that pollution, climate change, and overall degradation of the environment may eventually threaten human life, according to zoologists.
Researchers confirmed 35 new species of frog in Sri Lanka's dwindling rain forest over the past decade but also found that 17 frog species have disappeared and 11 others face imminent extinction unless their habitat is protected.
J. Alan Pounds -- resident scientist at the Tropical Science Center's Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve in Costa Rica and the study's lead author -- worked with 13 other researchers to pin down the link between rising temperatures in the tropics and the spread of the deadly chytrid fungus that has wiped out dozens of species of harlequin frogs in recent years.

D1035G-A : Agent Orange
Despite continuing investigation into possible links to birth defects, diabetes and a list of other illnesses, no scientific studies over the last two years has provided enough information to draw significant new conclusions about whether herbicides are linked to any condition, study director Dr. David Tollerud said.
Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., who as chief of naval operations in the early 1970s ordered the Navy to end racial discrimination and demeaning restrictions on sailors, then faced a haunting personal tragedy that he related to ordering the deployment of the defoliate Agent Orange in Vietnam, died Sunday at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C.
Vietnam has an estimated 1 million victims of Agent Orange, the toxic defoliant widely used by U.S. forces during the Vietnam War, according to the Vietnamese vice president.
An Air Force study of veterans who sprayed Agent Orange during the Vietnam War found the strongest evidence to date that exposure to the herbicide is associated with diabetes, officials said today.

D1036G-A : Dioxin Poisoning Yuschenko
The illness that disfigured the face of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko resulted from poisoning by the toxic substance dioxin, which might have been placed deliberately in his food, Austrian doctors who treated him told reporters in Vienna on Saturday.
New tests conducted Friday night at a hospital in Vienna, Austria, confirmed that Viktor A. Yushchenko, the Ukrainian opposition candidate for president, had been poisoned with dioxin, providing an explanation for a broad array of painful and disfiguring conditions that plagued him during the past three months of the campaign.
Zimpfer, who has been part of Yushchenko's medical team since he was first rushed to Rudolfinerhaus in early September, said that Yushchenko's blood dioxin level was "more than 1,000 times" the upper limits of normal and that his initial severe abdominal pain suggested that he had eaten the poison.
Ukraine's parliament decided Tuesday to investigate the recent sacking of the deputy chief of the country's SBU security service amid persisting questions on the poisoning of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko who has accused authorities of trying to kill him.

D1037G-A : Maryland Oysters
Teeming with raw sewage, animal waste and fertilizer runoff, yet responsible for half the Chesapeake Bay's fresh water, the Susquehanna River is the most endangered river in the United States, according to a report released this week by American Rivers, a national conservation group.
A Maryland environmentalist alarmed by the decline of the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster population is trying to get it on the federal Endangered Species list -- sparking an uproar of opposition in the oyster industry from Maine to Louisiana.
The oysters take about two years to grow large enough for harvesting, but Relyea wonders if he'll still be in business by then.
A Government Accountability Office review found that the Chesapeake Bay Program Office -- an arm of the Environmental Protection Agency -- has no coordinated, comprehensive plan for cutting pollution in the bay, even after nearly $6 billion in state and federal money has been devoted to the effort in the past decade.
But these days the harvest of native oysters, decimated by disease, pollution and overfishing, is measured in tens of thousands of bushels a year, a tiny fraction of the 20 million bushels that were once taken.

D1038G-A : Mt St Helens
After a week of steadily increasing seismic rumbling, Mount St. Helens on Friday burped a tall column of steam and ash that officials said was probably not a precursor to a large sustained eruption from the most active volcano on the West Coast.
The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the volcano, which killed 57 people during a major eruption in 1980, was shaken by a "tremor burst" for 25 minutes.
But on Saturday, the earthquakes intensified, and shortly after noon, the volcano emitted a brief burst of steam, which was followed by a continuous, low-frequency tremor that lasted 50 minutes, believed to be caused by the movement of magma, or molten rock, underground.
Hundreds of excited tourists who had flocked to Mount St. Helens in recent days were forced to move to a lookout point several miles below, causing a deep traffic jam on the one winding road that leads from this small town in southwestern Washington up to the mountain.
But those events, coming after the mountain erupted Friday for the first time in 18 years, were still less serious than what scientists closely monitoring the mountain had anticipated, and the scientists were still saying Monday that a more significant eruption was likely.

D1039G-A : Murder Van Gogh
Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh, who had received threats over a controversial film he made about Islam, was shot and stabbed to death Tuesday while cycling on an Amsterdam street, officials said.
A suspected Muslim extremist on Tuesday ambushed and killed an outspoken Dutch filmmaker who had received death threats because of his recent movie denouncing the abuse of women in Islamic societies, authorities said.
As the nation reeled from another daylight killing following the assassination of outspoken politician Pim Fortuyn in 2002, Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende condemned the attack.
The prosecutor charged seven suspects with ties to Islamic groups in the Netherlands, including the alleged murderer, with involvement in a conspiracy over the killing of Van Gogh and with plotting to kill Dutch liberal politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, but late Friday a judge ruled that two of the suspects should be released.
Police said the suspect, a 26-year old man with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality who was arrested shortly after the murder, had links to Islamic extremists.

D1040G-A : Robert Blake Murder Trial
M. Gerald Schwartzbach called 38 witnesses to emphasize the lack of evidence directly linking his client to the 2001 murder of Bonny Lee Bakley, and to attack the competence of the Los Angeles Police Department investigation, which focused early on the accused.
Prosecutors have built their case on the testimony of stuntmen Gary McLarty and Ronald ``Duffy'' Hambleton, who each testified Blake asked them to ``pop'' or ``snuff'' his wife, laying out multiple scenarios to kill her including one involving the restaurant near where she was killed May 4, 2001.
Amid gruesome testimony on blood-spatter patterns and ballistics, defense attorney M. Gerald Schwartzbach and prosecutor Shellie L. Samuels have waxed comedic on a variety of subjects, including the pitfalls of modern marriage and musings on why some people claim they buy Playboy magazine only for the articles.
After a 12-week trial that ended with jurors saying they did not believe two Hollywood stuntmen central to the prosecution's case, actor Robert Blake was found not guilty Wednesday of fatally shooting his wife.

D1041H-A : Coral Reefs
More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
Experts say the extent of devastation caused by the giant waves has laid bare some stark realities: the plight of poor fishing-folk forced to live on the fringe to earn a living, man's folly at clearing natural coastal habitats to chase the tourism dollar, and a modern ignorance of the power of the sea.
The global report, titled Status of Coral Reefs of the World: 2004, attributed bleaching of coral reefs off Taiwan's coasts to a combination of factors, including overfishing, waste-water pollution, damage by recreational divers and nuclear power plant operations.
Dozens of scuba divers are removing furniture and other debris swept into the ocean by the Dec. 26 tsunami, hoping to rescue fragile coral reefs and marine life that have long made Thailand's southern coast a top tourist destination.

D1042H-A : Lynndie England
The defense on Monday demanded that the judge be changed for the court martial of Private Lynndie England, the US soldier seen in photographs from Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison holding a leash attached to the neck of a naked inmate.
The 22-year-old private, who featured in some of the most graphic pictures of sexual humiliation of prisoners at the jail near Baghdad, told the hearing she had been following the orders of her former boyfriend, Specialist Charles Graner, one of the abuse ringleaders.
Her defense asked the judge to roll several maltreatment charges into one, which would bring the maximum sentence down to eight years.
Lynndie R. England, accused of abusing naked Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib prison, collapsed abruptly on Wednesday when a military judge threw out her guilty plea over testimony by the convicted ringleader of the scandal and father of her baby.
The judge, Col. James Pohl, dismissed the jury in the sentencing phase of her case and sent the year-old matter back to a lieutenant general who will weigh a range of options, including starting over or dismissing the case.

D1043H-A : Rafik Hariri
Saudi Arabia on Tuesday rejected a French demand for an international investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying Lebanon is an independent country.
Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese mourners gathered at the Mohamed Al Amin Mosque in the capital Beirut on Wednesday to pay last tribute to former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri killed in a suicide car bombing on Monday.
Hariri, a popular figure to many in Lebanon and a central figure in reconstructing the country after a devastating 15-year civil war, was assassinated on Monday in an explosion that many here believe was the work of Syria, whose forces have played a dominant role in Lebanon since the 1970s.
The family believes that Hariri's death was caused in part by the government's failure to provide security, and at their request no government officials attended the funeral.
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud on Thursday reappointed pro-Syrian Omar Karami to be the country's new premier, 10 days after Karami resigned under massive protests and pressure.

D1044H-A : Red Food Dye
The red-coloured dye, which is used for colouring non-edible items such as petrol and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli powder used by the British company Premium Foods to make Worcester Sauce, which was then used as an ingredient in a wide range of products, the FSA said.
The State Administration for Quality Supervision and Inspection and Quarantine Wednesday slapped a ban on imports of any foods containing the carcinogenic substance, and began screening foods from the European Union.
Britain's food watchdog said Thursday three companies were under investigation for their alleged role in a cancer scare that has triggered the country's largest food recall.
The red dye Sudan I has been found in a pepper sauce made by the Heinz Meiweiyuan Food Co. based in Guangzhou, capital of southern China's Guangdong province, Xinhua news agency said.
Fast food giant KFC's Chinese subsidiary will invest in a food safety centre to prevent health scares like the one this month over a cancer-causing dye found in its products, state press said Tuesday.

D1045H-A : Songhua River
China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) said here on Wednesday that the Songhua River in northeast China suffered a major water pollution incident owing to the explosion of a petrochemical plant at the upper reaches.
The river is the main source of drinking water supply to Harbin, a city of more than 3 million people.
Heilongjiang Provincial Bureau of Environmental Protection said in a press release that by 6 a.m. on Saturday, concentration of nitrobenzene monitored at Sujiatun upstream Sifangtai, one major water intake spot of Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, fell to 0.0793 mg per liter, but still above the state safety standard of 0.017 mg per liter, but the density of benzene stood at 0.0011 mg per liter, which is within the state safety benchmark.
A top official with the government's environmental safety agency visited Russia's far eastern regions Saturday to deal with the threat from tons of chemical pollutants flowing down a river from China, while Russia's ambassador to Beijing demanded information about the accident.

D1046H-A : Tsunami Indonesia
The Japanese government is committed to increase its aid for tsunami-hit Aceh and North Sumatra provinces to 146 million US dollars, Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia Yutaka Iimura said on Monday.
Uzbekistan on Monday sent a plane with 35 metric tons (39 short tons) of humanitarian aid to tsunami-hit Indonesia, the Foreign Ministry said.
The official news agency BSS Monday quoted the sources at the Department of Relief and Rehabilitation as saying that the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) would airlift a part of the food to Sumatra immediately after availability of aircraft and that the rest would be shipped for Sri Lanka in the next couple of days.
Sweden is prepared to freeze the 7.6 million-US dollar debt over the next two years owed by Indonesia, which was hard hit by last month's tsunami disaster, the Swedish finance minister announced on Wednesday.
A powerful earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Dec. 26, 2004 triggered a devastating tsunami that swept across the coastal countries of the Indian Ocean, wiping off villages and killing nearly 280,000 people.
