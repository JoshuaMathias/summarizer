Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, arrived here Wednesday from the West African nation of Guinea and said he was anxious to see the officers not only charged, but brought to trial.
Now that the four police officers charged with killing Amadou Diallo have been arraigned, the next step in the legal process will come at the end of the month, when their lawyers and Bronx prosecutors are to appear before a judge to set a schedule for the pretrial proceedings.
Albany's neighborhood leaders and minority politicians had gotten the attention they wanted on police conduct.

The two giant pandas at the city's zoo retired to their favorite spot under a few bushes and mated over the past two days _ the only successful natural insemination of a panda this year in the United States, officials said.
Doctors at a leading hospital in northwest China say Thursday's operation on a paralyzed giant panda has been a success but they cannot tell at the moment when it will be on its feet again, or whether it ever will.
The birth was seen as a hopeful sign for efforts to revive the endangered species.

The Papua New Guinea (PNG) Defense Force, the police and health services are on standby to help the victims of a tsunami that wiped out several villages, killing scores of people, on PNG's remote north-west coast Friday night.
Tsunami researchers at the National Tidal Facility (NTF) in Adelaide said Monday the northwest coastline had been identified as the most vulnerable area in Australia because of its proximity to the undersea earthquake-prone Java Trench, according to reports by the Australian Associated Press.
The official death toll from Friday's disaster was at least 700, mostly children and the elderly.

Momentum was growing for a fresh look at the safety of Celebrex and other pain relievers as key researchers, a congressman and European regulators said they feared such drugs might raise the risk of heart problems like those blamed on the arthritis medicine Vioxx.
When Merck withdrew Vioxx, S&P lowered its outlook to negative from stable.
The e-mail and meeting notes also show that Dr. David Graham, an official in the FDA's Office of Drug Safety, is seeking to begin a study of the safety of Bextra and Mobic, two arthritis pills that are similar to Vioxx.

Although the Ramsey's have long declined to be interviewed by police, whom they characterized as biased in the case, their attorney said recently the couple would cooperate with the grand jury.
JonBenet was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996 in her home in Boulder, Colorado.
Hunter ``has provided evidence to Ramsey defense attorneys at their request'' but denied requests by other witnesses for transcripts of their own statements to the police, wrote Fleet and Priscilla White, a couple who had the Ramsey family to their home for dinner on Dec. 25, 1996, a few hours before JonBenet was found dead.

A 48-month-old cow that died recently has been confirmed as having had mad cow disease, making it the 14th case in Japan, the country's Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said Thursday.
Since 1996, public health authorities have warned that people may catch vCJD from eating meat infected with mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or from infected blood transfusions.
Brain tissue samples from a suspected US beef cow began its trip to England on Thursday for final tests to confirm if it is the second case of mad cow disease in the United States.

Greek Defense Ministry and fire department said that the plane crashed to a mountain at about 12:20 p.m. (0920 GMT) near the coastal town of Grammatikos, about 40 kilometers north of Athens, just a few minutes before its scheduled landing time on a flight from Larnaca International Airport of Cyprus to Prague via Athens.
One month after Greece's worst air accident, a conclusive explanation of what caused a Cypriot Helios Airways airliner to crash killing all 121 people on board still eludes investigators, but recent reports suggest pilots may have failed to respond to a cabin pressure warning.

Leading opposition figure Amien Rais called on Soeharto over the weekend to donate 95 percent of his wealth to the state in return for complete forgiveness from the people so that the government should not have to beg for aid from international agencies and institutions.
JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib Monday said he would ask former President Soeharto to sign a letter of authorization that would enable the investigation team to probe Soeharto's overseas wealth.
The Indonesian government has set up two teams to investigate alleged corruption by Soeharto as well as his wealth.

The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that Floyd was expected to intensify today, becoming a Category 3 hurricane, and it could become a Category 4 with sustained winds of at least 131 mph by Tuesday afternoon, when it's expected to reach the northern Bahamas.
A hurricane that meteorologists said was four times the size of the infamous Andrew and potentially even more destructive pounded toward Florida Monday, forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes and leaving countless residents to hope that the massive storm would somehow miss their cities.
President Clinton issued pre-emptive disaster declarations for Florida and Georgia.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 20 people were taken hostage by six heavily armed men Sunday night from Sipadan island off Sabah, East Malaysia, but their motives behind the abduction are yet to be confirmed, Malaysian Police said Monday.
The hostages include two French nationals, three Germans, two South Africans, two Finns and one Lebanese, all tourists, he told a news conference here.
The Philippine Muslim extremist group Abu Sayyaf has threatened to behead some of the 21 hostages they abducted last Sunday in Malaysia because they do not want to talk with a government negotiator.

At a daylong public meeting on Wednesday, officials said they had more questions than answers about a spike in outbreaks of listeriosis like the one traced to hot dogs and cold cuts at Michigan's Bil Mar Foods plant in December that has killed 16 people and sickened more than 70 in 14 states.
A New Jersey company known for its high quality foods is voluntarily recalling 26 of it prepared products, including foie gras pates, mousses and terrines, and has forced the closing of the Huntington, N.Y., plant that produced them because of possible contamination with the sometimes deady bacterium, listeria monocytogenes.

Lafave was sentenced in Hillsborough County, where Tampa is located, to three years of house arrest and seven years probation after pleading guilty Nov. 22 to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery for having sex with the boy in a classroom and her home.
After the victim's family voiced concerns that forcing him to testify against the teacher amid intense media attention would be traumatizing, LaFave's lawyers and prosecutors reached a deal in which she would avoid prison while accepting a sentence of three years of partial house arrest and seven years of conditional release.

Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with a 1986 IWC moratorium.
The United States again is urging Japan to end its program of killing whales, which the Japanese say is for scientific research, and told Japan any expansion of the program would be unacceptable, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.
Australia condemned Japan's plan to more than double the number of whales it kills in the name of scientific research, pushing for a vote on the issue Wednesday at the annual meeting of the commision that regulates global whaling.

At least eight people have been confirmed killed and 30 others injured as two avalanches roared through a ski resort in Austria's western state of Triol on Tuesday evening, the Austrian news media reported.
LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Another killer avalanche brought new heartache to Western Austria today, striking just miles from where rescuers were digging for victims of Europe's worst snowslide this winter.
Justice Theodor Orr, writing for the majority, said the law contradicts extradition treaties Israel has signed -- but that as long as the law was on the books, he had to uphold it.

If the administration goes ahead with dropping the bears' current ``threatened'' status -- a move that would not take place until the end of 2006 at the earliest -- officials in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming would be free to allow limited hunting of grizzlies and would not have to maintain the same level of protection on the grizzlies' habitat.
Federal officials have begun the process of removing grizzly bears around Yellowstone National Park from the Endangered Species List, ending 30 years of protection and shifting responsibility for their management to state officials who may allow hunting.

David and Wanda turned in Theodore Kaczynski last year after authorities had mounted an unsuccessful 18-year search for the Unabomber.
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The trial of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski in Sacramento, California, is on hold following a surprise meeting with the judge and his lawyers, reportedly to air complaints about his defense, media reports said.
Ever since his brother's arrest in April 1996, David Kaczynski has said that he did not go to the FBI out of interest in the reward, which was offered in October 1993, but out of concern that more people could be hurt.

Abdul Samad Lasi, a senior official at Dera Bugti, said they had received reports from intelligence and security officials that more than 1,500 armed men from the dominant local Bugti tribe had taken up positions in mountains outside the town and were waiting for an order to attack government installations.
Salim Nawaz, said on Tuesday that thousands of Bugti tribesmen armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons have surrounded a military base near Dera Bugti, in Pakistan's southwestern Baluchistan province, with some setting up roadblocks and digging trenches.
Bugti accused security forces of provoking last week's fighting.

Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Monday that it was trying to seal off a gas leak on a platform in the North Sea where production had been suspended and most employees evacuated owing to the risk of an explosion.
Norway, the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia and which normally has an average daily production of three million barrels, has seen its production reduced by 345,000 barrels per day (bpd) since it shut down three offshore platforms.
No one was injured, but the leak forced the evacuation of 180 crew from Snorre A platform.

President Roh Moo-hyun on Tuesday said he will accept the resignation of South Korea's ambassador to the United States, who is stepping down over a burgeoning scandal surrounding the East Asian country's 1997 presidential election.
South Korean prosecutors said Thurday they have secured an arrest warrant for a former intelligence official accused of leaking a taped conversation detailing a slush fund payment by the Samsung Group.
South Korea's spy agency apologized Friday for illegally recording phone conversations involving influential figures and admitted that wiretapping continued long after former President Kim Dae-jung ordered an end to it in 1998.

Isolated reports of silent forests and empty streams began to circulate about three decades ago, but the latest assessment is the first to provide a complete snapshot of a global decline in the diversity of frogs, salamanders, newts, and worm-like caecilians, and to show that they are at greater risk than both birds and mammals.
In a decade-long study, a Wildlife Heritage Trust team found evidence of 35 new frog species, confirming the Indian Ocean island as the world's number one spot for frogs, with more than 200 known species, ahead even of rainforest-rich, biodiverse Costa Rica, Pethiyagoda told AFP.

Thursday's independent report by the Institute of Medicine appears to offer no new evidence that would affect benefits for Vietnam War veterans or their offspring, although the Department of Veterans Affairs said the study will be valuable for further research.
The rates of illness among the 1,000 veterans were compared to those of 1,300 other Air Force veterans who also served in the war but had no involvement in the spraying of agent orange, a herbicide that was used to defoliate trees and remove cover for North Vietnamese soldiers and Communist guerrillas in the south.

The illness that disfigured the face of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko resulted from poisoning by the toxic substance dioxin, which might have been placed deliberately in his food, Austrian doctors who treated him told reporters in Vienna on Saturday.
Returning to Kiev after checking out of a clinic in Vienna, Austria, Yushchenko said he was sure that authorities were responsible for the dioxin poisoning that had disfigured his face and caused other symptoms.
Dioxin also causes a severe skin disease, chloracne, which is the most visible of Yushchenko's problems, but this is usually not a fatal condition.

A Maryland environmentalist alarmed by the decline of the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster population is trying to get it on the federal Endangered Species list -- sparking an uproar of opposition in the oyster industry from Maine to Louisiana.
If it were revived to 25 times its current size -- about the level found between 1920 and 1970 -- excessive nitrogen levels in the bay would fall by 11 million pounds each year, and underwater grasses would increase by more than 20 percent, said the researchers, who are studying the oyster restoration methods for the state Department of Natural Resources.

A Dutch filmmaker who outraged members of the Muslim community with his works' attacks on the treatment of women in Islamic society was gunned down and stabbed to death on an Amsterdam street Tuesday morning.
The suspect in the murder of film maker Theo van Gogh, known for his controversial views on Islam, had ties with a group of extremist Muslims monitored by the intelligence services, the Dutch government said here late Tuesday.
Many here fear the fact that Van Gogh's alleged killer is of Moroccan descent could lead to ethnic tensions in Dutch society.

Robert Blake's defense rested its case without calling him to the stand, but he was able to tell jurors his story in a videotape of a TV interview that was played in court.
Blake ambushed his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, killing her after several other people refused to do the job for him, prosecutor Shellie Samuels argued.
Each acknowledges he failed to tell police about Blake's alleged solicitations to kill his wife until Bonny Lee Bakley was fatally shot on May 4, 2001, near a restaurant where she and Blake had dinner, the lawyer said.

Wreckage of the Amorgos, a Greek freighter that ran aground and sank off the coast of Kenting at the southernmost tip of Taiwan Jan. 14, 2001, is now "a slaughter hell" for coral in an area of Lungkeng off Kenting, said Cheng Ming-hsiu, Society chairman and a researcher with Academia Sinica's Institute of Zoology.
Dozens of scuba divers are removing furniture and other debris swept into the ocean by the Dec. 26 tsunami, hoping to rescue fragile coral reefs and marine life that have long made Thailand's southern coast a top tourist destination.

Lynndie England on Monday pled guilty to charges of abusing Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison but told a court martial she did not believe she was doing wrong when photographed holding a leash on a naked inmate.
Offering the most ordinary explanation to a scandal that ignited international outrage, England said she posed in some of the widely circulated photographs showing humiliating abuses of Iraqi detainees to placate her then-boyfriend and others from her Maryland-based unit.
Pohl scolded England's defense lawyers for presenting testimony by Graner suggesting that her actions were not illegal.

Saudi Arabia on Tuesday rejected a French demand for an international investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying Lebanon is an independent country.

Meanwhile, opposition groups, which accuse Syria of being behind Hariri's death, called for popular protests to continue until Syria withdraws its troops from Lebanon.

China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) said here on Wednesday that the Songhua River in northeast China suffered a major water pollution incident owing to the explosion of a petrochemical plant at the upper reaches.
Since the river was contaminated in a chemical plant explosion in the neighboring Jilin Province on November 13, the benzene and nitrobenzene density in the water is declining gradually after days of sedimentation and adsorption, and the Harbin city government has added a large amount of active carbon powders into the river to help clean up the water.

The Japanese government is committed to increase its aid for tsunami-hit Aceh and North Sumatra provinces to 146 million US dollars, Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia Yutaka Iimura said on Monday.
Sweden is prepared to freeze the 7.6 million-US dollar debt over the next two years owed by Indonesia, which was hard hit by last month's tsunami disaster, the Swedish finance minister announced on Wednesday.
Indonesia hopes to dispel concerns about official corruption in relief operations by announcing each month the amount of money it receives in foreign donations and where the funds are being spent, the government said Tuesday.
